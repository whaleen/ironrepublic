## CHAPTER 2

As soon as possible after the disastrous termination of my first and last political campaign. I turned everything I had into gold and going down to New York bought the line vessel which now lies in this harbour, somewhat the worse for wear, but still staunch and seaworthy. I shipped a good crew and a captain who had spent twenty years of his life playing hide and seek with icebergs
as master of a whaler. My intention was to go on a three. years' cruise into the Arctic regions and probably remain there, devoting the remainder of my life to the good of those isolated people, running the ship back and forth to the port of some civilised country.

After a conversation with Cap-
tain Brent. however. I changed my
plans and decided to go south in-
stead of north. My reason for this
was that Captain Brent had done all
of his whaling in southern waters and
was familiar with every piece of terra
ﬁrma from the straits of Magellan to
Kirgnelan's Land and knew nothing
whatever about the Arctic regions.
And inasmuch as my object was to

get away and as far away as possible
from the haunts of civilized men. I
readily agreed and drew the papers
for a three years’ cruise to extend as
far south as I should desire, “open
water permitting."

years' cruise, ﬁfty thousand dollars

vate cabin and a picked crew. l sail-
ed out of New York harbor literally
shaking the dust of my native coun-
try from my feet. and carrying a
lighter heart than I had for months
past.

It is not necessary to draw out
and magnify the incidents of this
voyage. There are writers, (W. Clark
Russel for instance.) whose business
in life is to describe sea voyages. The
chief interest in this story must lie
in what was accomplished by the
voyage and not the voyage itself. In

awning on the poop with Captain
Brent.—who was extremely well in-
formed for a seaman—or making

employed. Winds were very favor.
able considering the season of the
year and we drew down rapidly to-
wards the tropics.

()n the 10th of August we cross-
ed the equator and I brought out
half dozen bottles of wine and a box
of cigars and had the sailors. who
were all smart American boys. aft.
About the last of September we
passed the cape and began to realize
that we were indeed leaving the hab-
itable world and passing into a soli-
tude of waters whose southern boundaries were unknown. And here our real voyage began.

There is a ﬁerceness and black-
nus in these wild waters below the
cape that those familiar only with
the ship courses of the Atlantic and
Paciﬁc. can form no conception of.
Wilder and wilder grew the sea as
we drew southward, but Captain
Brent was an old navigator and I
feared the terrors of the whole An-
arctic region not so much as a single
cartoon in an American newspaper.

In a hundred and ﬁfty-one days
after leaving New York we encount-
ered ice and a month later we were
sailing along the southern ice bar-
riers that towered like sapphire cliffs
as far as the eye could see in either
direction. It was now summer time
in these regions and Captain Brent
said he had never seen the sea so
clear of ice. Whales spouted in every
direction and sea fowl by thousands
sailed above us or perched among
the icy precipices. The grandeur of
the scenery about us at this time baf-
fles description. As we sailed leisure-
ly east by south. there was a wall of
ice on our right. ranging from fifty to
three hundred feet high. giving out
with a splendor which no artist may
portray. the gorgeous hues of the
rainbow. In some places the eliﬁs
overhung making great grottoes in
which the largest ship might ﬂoat.

On the 23rd of December we
sighted the lofty summit of Mount

Erebus. the only volcano. so far as
is known in the Anarctic regions. 0n
the 29th., turning a spur or promon-
tory of ice that jutted out many miles
into the sea, we ran into a great cove
land-locked. or rather ice-locked.
where the water was smooth and where the cliffs shelved up gradually
from the water's edge, reaching back
and up many thousand feet, to where
the opal tinted ice shaded off into
the dull gray and brown oi the rug.
ged and barren rocks of Mount Ere-
bus.

Standing on the deck of the ship
and looking up the wide and irreg-
ular incline of ice that extended
from the water's edge tip to where
the rugged sides oi Mount Erehus
showed above, I enjoyed one of the
grandest sights ever looked upon by
man. This sloping incline was broken
into hundreds of terraces down
which the melting snow water dash-
ed in innumerable cascades and
poured into the sea. making great
banks of lleeey foam that froze and
tloated away. as it were. gossamer
icebergs.

As I gazed up this terraced in-
cline from the placid sea to the tow-
ering heights beyond. it looked like
a marble stairway leading up to
heaven. so broad and grand in its
mighty sweep that all the tribes of
earth might mount upon it. It was a
picture that Milton or Homer might
have used in their immortal epics of
gods and angels.

The water lapping over terraces
and leaping downward here and
there. was as white as milk and in the
distance looked like ganzy draperies
of lace and down spread on the
mighty stairway.“ archangel: might
spread them for gods to walk upon.
No grander sight was ever looked
upon by seer or prophet in the most
enraptured vision.

This phenomenon. so remarkable
in these regions of ice and snow.
where the temperature is always below the freezing point. was caused
by the heat of Mount Erebus melt-
ing the ice and snow that climbed up
its sides for thousands of feet. The
volcano was in' a mild state of erup-
tion and I suppose the hidden ﬁres
on this side had melted down the ice
walls and worn away this great thor-
oughfare to the sea 1) ' pouring down
a continuous Hood 0 water. The as-
cent looked accessible and I deter-
mined to make an eﬂ'ort to reach the
great cone and have a view of these
unknown regions. We had Christ-
mas dinner on board. after which
Captain Brent read from his manual
a service suitable for the occasion.
and perhaps with the exception oi
myself. every one on the ship yearn-
ed for home and its associations. on
this day of universal joy and glad-
ness. The boys looked blue enough until I brought out a great bowl of
punch. but that soon brought them
back to a state of warmth and merri~
ment. A ﬁne carouse the fellows had.
and when I proposed to lead a party
to climb Mount Erebus next day.
every one volunteered to go and my
only difﬁculty was in making a se-
lection. I chose three of the hardiest
and the next morning with rubber
boots reaching to our waists and so
wrapped in woolens that we might
pass a night without harm. (if
we could but get above the ice and
water.) we lowered a boat and pulled
in to the shelving beach. taking
along an extra crew to carry the boat
back to the vessel. Laying our boat
alongside the ice we had no diﬂiculty
in effecting a landing. as the water
was quite smooth and in many places
we could easily step out on to the ice.

To my surprise I found the ascent less difﬁcult than I expected. Picking out the easiest ways and keeping as much as possible out of the water. we reached a secondary cone or summit about two-thirds of the way up as darkness, or rather the twilight of
the Antarctic night, closed in upon us. The surface was quite dry and warm, and I never spent a more comfortable night in these frozen regions than on this lofty peak of Mount Erebus. Getting under a ledge of rocks that sheltered us from the wind, which cut like a knife. we slept soundly without fear of mice or bedbugs. That night we witnessed the grandest display of the aurora australis that perhaps any human eyes ever looked upon before. We were eight or nine thousand feet above the sea, and the luminous hands of purple and orange coloured light seemed to spring up from all around us and as they spread towards the zenith and then dipped umbrella shaped to the horizon, the white desolation of this frozen world was suffused with supernatural glory. As we looked out and away on the endless panorama of crags and cliffs and peaks of what seemed to be mountain ranges below us, all deathly white in this unearthly light, it looked like the ghost of a dead world. The scene was overpowering and after a hasty survey, we were glad to clamber down into our little gorge, out of the uncanny light and smoke our pipes, and hear each other's voices, to bring us back, as it were, to ourselves. This volcano is on the coast of Victoria land and in all probability we were the ﬁrst human beings who ever set foot on it. It is between 70 and 80 degrees south latitude and looking east or west as far as the eye could see, with the exception of the stairway like slope up which we had climbed, stretched an unbroken wall of ice. Looking southward though with the aid of a glass, I could plainly see an open sea very much like that on the north and clearer of ice. I studied the situation carefully. Here was the impentrable ice barrier that had bafﬂed every explorer of these southern seas. All below this latitude was supposed to be a continent of ice and snow. Men had sailed down here and been dashed against this wall or had gone back dismayed. But here on the south was the open sea which, if it could be reached, offered to the curious navigator opportunity to go, heaven only knew where. The more I looked at that great open sea, the more I became convinced that there was a passage somewhere through the icy wall cOnnecting these two bodies of water.

We made the descent without incident, and I instructed Captain Brent to hold a safe distance from the ice and circumnavigate the entire Antarctic circle or ﬁnd a passage through the ice. Fully imbued then with the idea that the earth was a sphere, I supposed that this body of water on the south was simply an open polar sea, surrounded by walls of ice.

The next day it came on to blow a gale of sleet and snow and we
sought northward for four days through such a storm as can only rage in the frozen seas about the south pole. During these entire four days it was so dark that we could not see the topmast from the deck though every spar and shroud was white with ice. Several times 


—— page 151

we were in dangerous proximity to
icebergs, but standing to windwards
as we were. we could smell the
mighty monsters though we could
not see them. and keep away. This
"smell" of an iceberg, as it is called
by seamen, is the peculiar crispness
oi the air blowing over one of these
great bodies of ice and may be felt
for miles. The vessel was awash
from capstan to wheel. and though
we could carry scarcely more can-
vas tltan would give us steerage
way, her lee scuppers were most oi
the time dragging through the hiss-
ing brine and it was absolutely neces.
sary for every man above deck to lash
himself to the rigging to keep from
beim.r washed overboard. Cooking
was out of the question and for [our
days there was no ﬁre in the cook's
galley. our diet during this time
consisting: of sea biscuit and tinned
food with an occasional panikin ol
rum to keep up the warmth. It was
a fearful time and though we had
encountered much heavy weather on
the voyage. we had experienced
nothing comparable with this. In-
deed. Captain Brent said afterwards.
that itt all his twenty years of voy-
aging in these waters he had never
passed through so terrible a gale.
Only the staunchness of our ship
and the skill and experience of our
skipper saved us from destruction.
it may not be irreverent or pre-
sumptious in me also. to ieel that an
over-ruling Providence guided us
through this ice strewn and storm
whipped sea. that the great results
oi our voyage might be achieved.
When the terriﬁc storm subsided
and the atmosphere cleared so that
we could again see about us. the
towering ice barriers were nowhere


— page 152


to be seen. How ntttch northing we
had made it was impossible [or us to

if there was such a thing.

Fourteen days after this. during
which time we encountered all sorts
of weather. (for there are never many
days together in these seas without
a wiltl snort of wind and snow lrom
some direction.) Captain Brent call-
ed tne up irom my cabin and hand-
ing tne his glass directed my atten-
tion to an opening in the wall oi ice
heiore us. 'l'wo crystal prontontories
jutted out into the water on either
hand and between. a narrow bttt
well deﬁned and opened strait. We
could not see through. as it was sinn-
ons. but after observing it for some
tittte. we could perceive by the loose
ice that was ﬂoating about the
mouth that a current set into it.

I instantly gave directions to have
the vessel headed into this strait.
In vain Captain Brent rentonstrated
anti declared that we must be lost if
we encountered an ice pack or were
overtaken by a storm in this narrow
place. "The wind is lair." said he.
"but ii We encountered an ice pack
blocking the passage as we most
likely shall. we can never navigate
the ship out again withottt more sea
rcmm."

it was the first serious disagree-
ment we had ever had since we start-
cul on the voyage. and I could not
httt feel that as navigator. with the
reslamsibility for the safety of the
vcescl and the lives of the crew he

— page 152

was right. I begged him though to
lay in as close as he could to the
month of this strait. that we might
examine it more closely and on this
we compromised and put the vessel's
head in towards the opening. intend.
ing to heave to and claw oi? the
shore. as the wind was light and the
sea comparatively calm.

.\nd here it did seem that Provi-
dence was furthering my apparently
wild purpose: for when he had
dropped the ship into within a iew
hundred feet oi the opening and or-
dered the helm down to bring her
about. the wind suddenly failed so
that there was not steerage way
enough to bring the vessel’s head
around and we drifted helplessly at
the mercy of the waves. Instantly
all was commotion. for a ship on a
shore without wind is in as perilom
condition as a steamer with a broken
wheel. The bow anchor was quick-
ly cleared and the lead cast. but there
was no bottom and so to cast anchor
would be useless. The current had
now caught us and there was noth-
ing [or it but to head straight intn
the opening. or be broken to pieces
on the icy promontories that stood
out like Scylla and Charibdis on
either hand. My heart hounded as we
passed between the towering ice
walls. and I felt a thrill of excitement
such as Columbus must have experi'
enced when the long looked for .\n-
tilles lifted on his expectant vision.

(“ILI "RE "I.

The apprehensions of Captain
Brent proved groundless. The pay
sage was open and though there was
considerable ﬂoating ice. the current
was driving it in the same direction
and we experienced no ditiiculty in

— page 153

sailing through. Indeed it was im-
pmsihle for us to do anything but
go through. for after we had gotten
fairly into the strait the current was
like a mighty. swift. ﬂowing river
and had there been a fair wind to go
back it must have blown half a gale
to drive us against such a tide as was
sweeping through. I was convinced
that this was a permanent strait and
not merely an accidental break in
the great barriers. The regular
smoothness of the sides showed the

— page 153

effects of a continuous current and
the abrasions of great masses of ice
carried through by it. I say I was
convinced then: hut when on our re-
turn we found the passage in every
rc~pect practically in the same Cull-
tiition as when we passed through
“N. there was positively no room

sea with its wierd strange glow so
that it was easy for us to keep the

was now to circumnavigate this polar

I will not weary the reader with the
details of our long voyage in this
hitherto unknown .ocean. In the
course of time the sun again appear-
ed and as we drew southward the
sea became cleared of ice and the
cold moderated as it does in travel-
ing from the poles to the equator.
ln rain we looked for the ice barriers
which we supposed surrounded us:
only the black open sea stretched on
and we held our course. There were

— page 155

no exciting incidents and four
month after passing the barriers. we
were sailing in open seas out of the
region of ice and snow with the
weather constantly growing warmer.
Two months later we encountered
driit wood and not long afterwards
seaiowls appeared and grew won
numerous every day. They ﬁrst ap-
peared on the starboard side, and as
their number increased from day to
day including some that were un-
mistakably land birds. I expressed
the opinion to Captain Brent that
we were sailing parallci to some coast
and suggested that the ship's course
be altered to make this shore. This
was done and evidences of land such
as seaweed and driitwood became
more apparent every da’v.

My interest and excitement be-
came so great that I could not be
still a moment when awake and could
sleep but little. In a lever oi rest-
lessness I walked the deck hour after
hour and scanned the horizon (or
land ta perfectly useless waste oi en-
ergy. as a man was stationed in the
lookout. who of course would see
the land long before it became visible
from the deck.) The weather was
ﬁne and we were evidently nearing
land of some kind.

.\s night closed on the 20th of
July. an. illumination of some kind
was plainly visible on the horizon of
the starboard how and the vessel‘s
head was turned towards it. My
excitement was so great that I did
tmt go down to my cabin for supper.
The illumination grew plainer con-
stantly. and at ten o‘clock the look-
out at the mast head said he could
distinguish what seemed to be elec-
tric lights. At this my hopes fell. 1
had been thrilled with the idea of

— page 155

approaching an unknown land in an
unknown ocean. and now it seemed
that in some way we had gotten hack
into the beaten track of the world
and was approaching a modern city.
Captain Brent was of the opinion
that it was one of the cities on the
west coast of South America. al-
though it was impossible to under-
stand how we could have gotten
there as we had been sailing south

polar regions. In a short time it was
plainly to be seen from the deck that
we were approaching a considerable
city. lighted hv electricity. .\s we
neared the land the lead was heaved
constantly and alter running in as
close as he dared. the captain cast
anchor and waited for daylight he-
fore attempting to enter the harbor.

As soon as the ship was made
snug and everything became quiet
on hoard. l was struck by the strange
silence of the city that lay before us.
Although evidently a large citv and
a modern one. lif we might judge
from the brilliant manner in which it
was lighted.) there was an entire ab-
sence of that roar and rumble which
characterizes the modern American
or European city. As a matter of
fact. although we lay within a few
miles. no sound of any kind came to
us and the silence was strange and
wiertl-like. as though it was some
brilliantly illuminated city of the
dead.

I was awakened next morning the
the creaking of the winch and the
rattling of the cable as the anchor
was hoisted, and dressing hurriedly
I went on deck where the captain
and crew were discussing the small
craft that was coming out of the
harbour. Even as we looked a most


— page 156

remarkable boat came tearing out
and pitching towards us at the rate
of at least ﬁfty miles an hour. .-\s it
came towards us we could see only
a great hillow of foam and above it
a covered deck something like a ferry
boat or excursion barge. When it
came alongside of us we could see
that the vessel. (if such a thing may
be called a vessel.) consisted of a
long cigar shaped hull submerged
after the fashion of the American
whalehack. with the superstructure
raised on stanchious. On each end
of this cylindrical hull were great
cone shaped screws somewhat larger
than the hull itself. and it was these
that raised the hillows of foam as
they leaped through the water. push-

desired would be afforded us.

perience. that he would be under the
necessitv of conducting him to the
oﬂice oi the Director oi Navigation.
Thereupon. the captain introduced
me an owner and the proper perm:

requested me to accompany him.

“Sir.” said I. as we passed through
the curious throng that had gather-
ed on the wharf. “will you be kind
enough to tell me what country thix
is and in what part of the world it
lies ?"

"This." he replied. “is the Iron
