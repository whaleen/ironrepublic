# Chapter 3


The apprehensions of Captain Brent proved groundless. The pay 
sage was open and though there was
considerable ﬂoating ice. the current
was driving it in the same direction
and we experienced no ditiiculty in

sailing through. Indeed it was im-
pmsihle for us to do anything but
go through. for after we had gotten
fairly into the strait the current was
like a mighty. swift. ﬂowing river
and had there been a fair wind to go
back it must have blown half a gale
to drive us against such a tide as was
sweeping through. I was convinced
that this was a permanent strait and
not merely an accidental break in
the great barriers. The regular
smoothness of the sides showed the

— page 153

effects of a continuous current and
the abrasions of great masses of ice
carried through by it. I say I was
convinced then: hut when on our re-
turn we found the passage in every
rc~pect practically in the same Cull-
tiition as when we passed through
“N. there was positively no room

this xtrait is always open. but I do

the length of the passage to be about

practically the same features as on

The sun. which had been rising but
a little way above the horizon for
some time past. disappeared entirely
soon after We got into the open sea
beyond the barriers. but when the
air was not ﬁlled with sleet or snow.
it was never really dark. The aurora
australis too. frequently lighted the
sea with its wierd strange glow so
that it was easy for us to keep the
irozcn coast line in view. My object
was now to circumnavigate this polar
Sea. Sailing eastward alongr the

"Harrington Strait" (as l have been
egotistical enough to christen it.» we
had storms. snow and ice and the

ploughed was in no wise ditl'erent

Horn to Victoria Land. except that

on this side. both going and coming.
I will not weary the reader with the
details of our long voyage in this
hitherto unknown .ocean. In the
course of time the sun again appear-
ed and as we drew southward the
sea became cleared of ice and the
cold moderated as it does in travel-
ing from the poles to the equator.
ln rain we looked for the ice barriers
which we supposed surrounded us:
only the black open sea stretched on
and we held our course. There were

— page 155

no exciting incidents and four
month after passing the barriers. we
were sailing in open seas out of the
region of ice and snow with the
weather constantly growing warmer.
Two months later we encountered
driit wood and not long afterwards
seaiowls appeared and grew won
numerous every day. They ﬁrst ap-
peared on the starboard side, and as
their number increased from day to
day including some that were un-
mistakably land birds. I expressed
the opinion to Captain Brent that
we were sailing parallci to some coast
and suggested that the ship's course
be altered to make this shore. This
was done and evidences of land such
as seaweed and driitwood became
more apparent every da’v.

My interest and excitement be-
came so great that I could not be
still a moment when awake and could
sleep but little. In a lever oi rest-
lessness I walked the deck hour after
hour and scanned the horizon (or
land ta perfectly useless waste oi en-
ergy. as a man was stationed in the
lookout. who of course would see
the land long before it became visible
from the deck.) The weather was
ﬁne and we were evidently nearing
land of some kind.

.\s night closed on the 20th of
July. an. illumination of some kind
was plainly visible on the horizon of
the starboard how and the vessel‘s
head was turned towards it. My
excitement was so great that I did
tmt go down to my cabin for supper.
The illumination grew plainer con-
stantly. and at ten o‘clock the look-
out at the mast head said he could
distinguish what seemed to be elec-
tric lights. At this my hopes fell. 1
had been thrilled with the idea of

— page 155

approaching an unknown land in an
unknown ocean. and now it seemed
that in some way we had gotten hack
into the beaten track of the world
and was approaching a modern city.
Captain Brent was of the opinion
that it was one of the cities on the
west coast of South America. al-
though it was impossible to under-
stand how we could have gotten
there as we had been sailing south

polar regions. In a short time it was
plainly to be seen from the deck that
we were approaching a considerable
city. lighted hv electricity. .\s we
neared the land the lead was heaved
constantly and alter running in as
close as he dared. the captain cast
anchor and waited for daylight he-
fore attempting to enter the harbor.

As soon as the ship was made
snug and everything became quiet
on hoard. l was struck by the strange
silence of the city that lay before us.
Although evidently a large citv and
a modern one. lif we might judge
from the brilliant manner in which it
was lighted.) there was an entire ab-
sence of that roar and rumble which
characterizes the modern American
or European city. As a matter of
fact. although we lay within a few
miles. no sound of any kind came to
us and the silence was strange and
wiertl-like. as though it was some
brilliantly illuminated city of the
dead.

I was awakened next morning the
the creaking of the winch and the
rattling of the cable as the anchor
was hoisted, and dressing hurriedly
I went on deck where the captain
and crew were discussing the small
craft that was coming out of the
harbour. Even as we looked a most


— page 156

remarkable boat came tearing out
and pitching towards us at the rate
of at least ﬁfty miles an hour. .-\s it
came towards us we could see only
a great hillow of foam and above it
a covered deck something like a ferry
boat or excursion barge. When it
came alongside of us we could see
that the vessel. (if such a thing may
be called a vessel.) consisted of a
long cigar shaped hull submerged
after the fashion of the American
whalehack. with the superstructure
raised on stanchious. On each end
of this cylindrical hull were great
cone shaped screws somewhat larger
than the hull itself. and it was these
that raised the hillows of foam as
they leaped through the water. push-
ing and dragging the strange looking
boat. .\ uniformed pilot was put

"What land is this?" asked Cap-
tain Brent in turn.

the pilot. again saluting. and advanc-
ing to the wheel. lu resptmse to our
further questioning. he courteonsly
stated that he was an ofﬁcer on duty.
that it was against the rules for him
to hold any conversation except in
reference to the ship and begged us
to curb our curiosity tmtil we got
ashore. when all the information we
desired would be afforded us.

— page 156

There was nothing else ior us to
do. so Captain Brent turned his at.
tention to lowering and iurling the
sails which had heen hoisted. and h}-
the time every thing was made mug.
we were alongside the pier.

other oﬂicer came on hoard and he.
like the pilot. seemed to he dumb.
founded when he learned that the
\‘CSSC' hailed from the United Slales
of America. Alter inspecting the
ship's papers. he turned to Captain
Brent and inionned him that the en-
cumstances ol our arrival were so
unusual and unprecedented in his ex-
perience. that he would be under the
necessitv of conducting him to the
oﬂice oi the Director oi Navigation.
Thereupon. the captain introduced
me an owner and the proper perm:
to deal with. and the officer politely
requested me to accompany him.

“Sir.” said I. as we passed through
the curious throng that had gather-
ed on the wharf. “will you be kind
enough to tell me what country thix
is and in what part of the world it
lies ?"

"This." he replied. “is the Iron
Republic and the continent on which
von stand lies about as far from the
irozen ocean as your own continent
ol America does in the opposite di-
rection."

Just here. having reached the out-
skirts of the crowd. he made a signal
and a man approached with a horse-
less vehicle and distnottnting salut-
ed and opened the door ol‘ his car-
riage. Forltearing to question fur-
ther an otlicer of whose power and
authority I had not the slightest idea.
and whose extreme courtesy iorhade

carriage and was whirled along wide.

smooth streets through the heart of
the city. I have remarked that
though we lay just outside of the
harbor and in sight of the city for
sottte hours before entering. we
heard none of that roar and rnnthle
inseparahle from cities of its apparent
size among us. The reason was now
plain. In the first place the streets
were all as smooth as a tennis court
and there was nothing to make a
noise. There was ttot a horse to be
seen and it was evident from the
door-like cleanliness of the streets
that they were not intended for the
use of horses and wagons. On all
sides were horseless vehicles of every
description. from the lightest hi-
cyclcs to large covered vans. all rnh-
lncr tired. whirling to and fro swiftly
and without noise.

I had only time to note the things
referred to.and to remark the strange
and picturesque costumes of the
ladies and gentlemen who were on
the street. when my conductor drew
up before a large substantial stone
building covering an entire hlocla.
Stepping down front the carriage. he
assisted me to alight and ushered
me into a large and well lighted re-
ception room in the front of the
building. I noticed as we approached
that a hltte flag with a white star
ﬂoated from the tower on the roof.
and surmised that in some way the
two ofﬁcers with whom I had been
brought in contact and the building
which we had just entered. repre-
sented the same department of gov-
ernment. .

Conducting me to one of the cont-
fortahle seats with which the room
was supplied. my companion excus-
ed himself by saying that the gentle-
man who tnet me at the boat would

withdrew. Scareer had he passed
through the door when the person
referred to dune in. having presume
ably ridden up after us in his own
carriag . Smiling pleasantly. he ex-
pressed the hope that I would not he
annoyed by the little cmwentionali-
ties to which I was being subjected.
saying that my arrival was so estra-
ordinary and so out of common
with all other entries made since he
had been connected with the marine.
that he had no other recourse but to
refer me to the head of the depart-
meat. I assured him that l was under
obligations for his courteous atten-
tion: that a stranger as l was and
dazed hy the extraordinary circum.
stances in which I found myself. I
was in a condition to absolutely re-
quire guidance and direction.

He desired me to consider myself
under no restraint whatever. stating
that l was heing referred to the chief
of the llureau of Navigation. because
he was at a loss to know how to
place me on the marine register.
Opening a door he conducted me
without ceremony into the presence
of a gentleman whom he introduced
as "Director of Navigation and Chief
of the Department of the Marine."
This oﬂiccr. notwithstanding his evi-
dent high position. rose and smiling
cordially bowed and asked us hoth to
he seated. In a few words the snlinr~
dinate explained to his superior the
circumstances of my arrival and ask-
ed for instructions in certain matters
pertaining to the registering of my
vessel. These were given and then
the high oliicial with rare feeling and
tact arose and grasped my hand and
welcomed me to the Iron Republic:
saying that though it might lack the

— page 158

associations which must make my
native country pleasant. it possessed
advantages and attractions which he
believed. front what he had been able
to learn. cottld not he found in Amer-
ica. I thanked him for his cordial
greeting and assured him that while
some associations of my own coun'
try had been pleasant. others were
very unpleasant and upon the whole
I was glad to have found my way
to the "Iron Republic." whatever
and wherever it might he.

Mter inquiring into the details of
my voyage in which he manifested
great interest. the director remarked
that the astonishment of his country-
men at my arrival would naturally
be much less than mine. inasmuch
as they had a very thorough knowl-
edge of my country. It was known.
he said. front the settlement of his
country that the American conti-
nent existed: indeed that it was the
attempt of a ship load of emigrants
to get to America that led to the dis-
covery of the continent on which the
magniﬁcent structure ofgovermnent
known as the iron Repuhlic had
been reared. T his was in 1698. aml
driven southward by ﬁerce gales the
colonists after many months of bat-
tling with storm and ice. fouml them-
selves cast on the inhospitable shores
of a new world. For many years af-
ter the first settlement was made. it
was suplmsed by the colonists that
they were on a portion of the Ameri-
can continent. but with the develop
ment of the country. the increase of
knowledge aml the researches of
navigators. it was fouml that they
had heen discoverers as well as col-
univcrs. They knew all that was

Cuntincnt up to the time they were

— page 158

so effectually cut at? from the hal-
ance of the civilized world and with-
in the past fifty years two other
.\merican ships had drifted to their
shores. When l told him how many
lives had been lost and how much
treasure had been squandered by
America and other nations in Artie
explorations. and expressed surprise
that a people so advanced in the arts
of civilization as his nation appeared
to he. should make no attempts to
establish communication with other
parts of the world. but should remain
isolated for centuries. he smiled
pleasantly and said he could appre-
ciate my feelings.

In the ﬁrst place he explained that
the Iron Republic had never been
engaged in maritime connneree to
any considerable extent even in the
days when trading was encouraged.
as there were no other great mari-
time nations to trade with. as a con-
sequence there was not that passion
for voyaging and exploration. which
obtains among a maritime people.
Nevertheless. some attempts had
been made to get through the bar-
riers and as vessels had sailed away
and never returned. it was supposed
at the time. that some of them might
have succeeded in the attempt. Since
the establishment of the great repub-
lic though. no eﬁorts had been made
in that direction for the reason that
there was not sufficient private cap-
ital to undertake such enterprises
and from the knowledge they had
of the outside world. the government
did not desire cl0ser intercourse
with the older nations as it could not
possibly do them any good and
might result in much hami. This. he
admitted. was a species of national
selﬁshness: "hut selﬁshness." said he.

— page 159

with a smile. "is human and is one
thing we have in common with all
peoples past and present." He then
told me that a Captain Morris had
reached their country with a ship
and crew during the progress of the
great civil war and that some years
before that an old American whaler
had come to their shores. The whaler
remained with them a year and then
left with the intention oi making his
way back to America and was never
heard of again. Ca tain Morris. he
informed me. was t en in the coun-
try and being a man oi great ability
was at the head oi the government
naval college. The most of his crew,
too. were still living and were estab-
Iishetl in different parts of the coun-
trv.

'At the conclusion of an hour at
pleasant conversation the aﬂahle Di-
rector touched a hutton. saying that
it was very probable that the press
had given out the details of my ar-
rival. Speaking into a bell-shaped
transmitter directly over his table
he called "current news." and then
pushed back his chair in a listening
attitude.

In a moment a voice. rich. strong
and distinct. answered hack through
the transmitter. "Current news !"—

“Special resume at 1.: o'clock."

The voice ceased and touching tltc
button again. the director turtted to
me. I have not given all. or anything
like half what came to us as current
news, lntt just simply a sample. I etu-
qnired if this news was heing read
from a dail_v paper through the tel.

sponded to it) itself. .

"Do you mean to say." I asked
with astonishment. “that all of the
people get the news as we ltave just
heard it ?"

“I mean to say." answered tlt div
rector. "that several millions of peo-
ple heard or had the opportunity of
hearing the same voice. giving out
the same news that we have just list—
ened to."

".\ttd there is no paper printed ?" I

asked. scarcely able to grasp the idea
of melt in news' service.

".\' one except what is primed right
there." (pointing to a small machine
I had noticed ticking on the table.)

produced there in print and can be

stroyed at the option of the patron."
I stepped to the table and looked.
but could make nothing of the cahao
listic signs on the paper before me.
"llow is it." I enquired. “that you
speak the English language and do
not use the Roman characters as oth-
er linglish speaking people do?"

'°\\'e used the saute letters." ans-
wered the director. "until the dis-
covery of sound characters. Most oi
our books are printed in the old way.

"What do you call a sound char-
acter?" i asked.

"I may not be able to make you
understand." said the director. "if
you are unfamiliar with the develop-
ment and progress of the knowledge
of sound." I told him that the nature
of sound as atmospheric vibrations
was well understood by us and meu’
tionedthe telephone and phonograph
in common use as an illustration.
“Very well then." said he. “it is sim-
ple enough. The vibrations are com
municated to the machine and the
machine transmutes them into char-
acters. Reproduce a sound a million
times and it will make the same char-
acter every time. It is a true phonet-
ic system and is Nature's own writ-
ing."

Amazed at a civilization evidently
so far in advance of ours. I had for-
gotten the circtnnstances by which

— page 161

l was surrounded and would have
questioned further. but the genial of-
ticial excused himself. saying that his
duties would deprive him of the fur-
ther pleasure of my company at that
time. but that he hoped to meet me
again smut. outside of business hours
and in a social way. In the mean-
time. I would receive the attention of
the government. Pressing another

and returned to the whari. .-\s l ap-
proached. in the conduct of the same
ofﬁcer who had carried me from the
hunt. the curious crowd fell back re-
spectfully and I passed on hoard.
Notwithstanding our position was
one calculated to repress every emo-
tion except astonishment. I found
('aptain Brent in a tremendous state
of wrath and the steward was de-
scribing: the heathenish country to

quent. (in learning the cause. 1
found that the last named dignitary
had been out in the city trying to
purchase fresh meats and vegetables,
of which the men stood in great need
after their long voyage. It seemed
though. that neither gold or silver
would he accepted in payment and
so the dinner of freth victnals that
all had looked forward to so eager-
ly. was not in sight. We were soon
relieved. however. by the appearance
of a van load of fresh supplies. which
the vendor said was brought on an
order from the Marine oliice.

I retired to my cabin and tried to
collect my thoughts. I had been hut
a few hours in this wonderful coun-
try and already my senses had taken
in more. it seemed to me. than my
mind could analyze and digest in
weeks. i felt as if I would like to get
away by myself for two or three
days and think it over. Everything
was so new and strange. that all
mental effort was directed to grasp-
ing the situation.

AFTER a dinner of fresh meats
and vegetables, the first we
had tasted since we left Amer-

ica. l was called on by Prof. Morris. a
ﬁne looking gentleman. apparently
about sixty-fire years old. who came
aboard with the burgontaster of the
city and several other persons of po-
sition, and welcomed as all to the
lron Republic. Onr cmnttryntan
seemed delighted to see its and he
was to me the one link that connect-
ed us with a former world and int-
parted reality to scenes and circum-
stances that wonld otherwise have
seemed an illusion. After an hour's
conversation: in which the voyage
was discussed and in which I learn-
ed that he had come through the
barriers by the same channel that
we had. he left us saying that he
would call in the evening and take
Captain Brent and myself to the
opening of the new temple where we
would have the opportunity to see
the president and meet him after-
wards.

— page 234

Prof. Morris was of the same
opinion as myself in regard to the
permanency oi tlte strait which
brought us through the barriers. but
lte thought it probable that it might
be gorgetl with ice and remain clos-
ed [or years at the time. Indeed he
thought that it was perhaps only
open at rare intervals when the seas
were unusually clear of ice. However
that may be. I found the strait open
both going and coming and except
for the current experienced no (lif-
ﬁculty whatever in getting through.
and it is my opinion. based on a
th ° which I have formed and
ultra will he htlly explained in my
forthcoming hook. that there is yet
another passage through these har-
riers which may he found if it is
sought for with half the ardor that
has been devoted to Arctic explora-

tions.

We accompanied Prof. Morris to
witness the opening of the new
temple that evening and as we tool:
our places in the tier of seats set
apart for visitors and strangers. I

never gazed upon a ﬁner interior or
saw a more superior audience. From
pit to gallery was such an array 0!
iemale toilets as was never dreamed
oi in America. Indeed it scented to
me. as my eyes swept over the mag-

ed remarkable to me was. that the
people in the last gallery were just
as handsomer dressed as any in the
house. I called Proi. Morris‘ atten-
tion to this and he iniormed me that
there were no social diﬂ'erences in
any part oi the house: that the seats
were all drawn by lot and the most
distinguished person in the city
might draw a seat in the gallery.
while a hod carrier got the best in
the house. As a matter oi iact he
said it would be difﬁcult to make so-
cial distinctions. as the President oi
the Republic was a brick mason.

a rockbonnd shore and then could
be seen a dismantled ship drifting
to wreck and ruin. Altogether. it
was the grandest thing I ever saw.

nius could produce. Another ﬁne ef-

by a pure white light. bright as day
and then the curtain rose. As it roll-
ed up a picture was seen in the back-
ground. at the sight oi which the
concourse oi live thousand people
rose as one man and waved their
handkerchieis and applauded to the
top oi their bent. It was a simple
picture and yet it evoked the wildest
enthusiasm. Just a backing of slty
and in the ioreground a massive iron
pillar with a quality oi solidity and in-
erita about it which no words can
convey. ()verarching the pillar
was a rainbow and on it were inscrib-
ed the words. "The State Was Made
For Man. Not Man For The State."
0n the pillar was the statute oi a
man with a hammer poised and
above it tloated a blue tlag with a
white star in the center. This was
the device oi the Iron Republic and
certainly ii enthusiasm proves any-
thing. it was a loyal audience.

When the cheering ﬁnally subsid-
ed a rather stout. awkward looking
gentleman walked out on the stage
and was received with an ovation.
He appeared to he young. though
prematurely bald. and so timid that
it was not until after several eﬂorts
that he succeeded in ﬁnding his
voice. When he did. he introduced
another gentleman. tall and haml-
some. as "l'roi. Churchill. the author
oi the 'Winter King' and an artist
whom we all delight to honor." The
artist received his mecd oi applause
and howing with a gratiﬁed smile
they both leit the platform. "Ah."
said i turning to Prof. Morris. "now
i perceive that I am indeed in the
iron Republic. for your Churchill
would never have gotten oti' in
American without a speech."


— page 236

"Never iear." replied my com-
panion. "we will doubtless have
speeches enough heiore we are
through. even in the Iron Republic."

0n enquiring who the timid young
man was that appeared on the stage
ﬁrst and was received with such ap-
plause. l was informed that it was
Proi. Hallam oi the National Con-
servatory and the greatest musician
in the republic. .-\iter this incident.
a line looking gentleman advanced
to the center oi the stage in from oi
the picture. bearing a silver shield on
which rested a massive key oi gold.
1 was mtuewhat startled at this lav-
ishness. hut I was to learn to my
cost. that gold in that country was
a vastly different thing irom gold
in other parts oi the world.

Walking to iront. the gentleman
spoke as iollows: “Fellow citizens.
I have the honor to present to ,vou
through your executive this evening.
the keys to this ediﬁce which is to

vation and happiness oi our race. Its
iouudations are oi granite. its walls
oi marble. its rooi oi glass and phos-
phorobronze.—imperishahle materi-

of time. Fellow citizens. I deliver
to you that which is yours and relin-
quish all right and claim to it what-
ever!"

Here a modest looking gentleman
with stooping shoulders and the car-
riage of a working man. mounted
the platform amid perfect tumult of
applause and lifting the key from the
shield with a bow. thanked the archi-
tect. (for such he was). in a few well
chosen words. for the skill and pains-
taking bestowed in the creation 0!
such a work of art: and as that gen-
tleman retired from the stage. turn-
ed to the audience and spoke in part
as follows: “Fellow citizens. The
earth may be likened to a great lab-
orato where things are made. test-
ed an improved. and where notho
ing is perfect enough as yet. to be
stamped with the seal of immortal-
ity. So far. eternal power seeks no
permanent form. Chanceless in its
nature. it is most changeful in its
manifestations and expresses itself in
a million forms that wax and wane
and pass away. leaving the spirit of
power to enter other bodies. Under
the dust of the moistless desert we
ﬁnd the track of the long perished
river. Beneath the greenest land-
scape, lie other landscape lmried. So
in the realm of thought. Delve
where we may, in literature. art.
philosophy or religion. we evermore
turn up the ashes of things that
were; and so in turn. shall the dust
of things which are. slip through
Time's fingers and find the roots of
things to be.

And as genius moulds and re-
moulds the pliant clay till the perfect
form is reached: as the eagle with
each revolution in his circling ﬂight


— page 237

mounts upward to the sun, so Na-
ture. in her ceaseless evolutions
grows more perfect with each suc-
ceeding change. The earth born
wrestler in the Greek mythology
was thrown down but sprang up. re-
strengthened by contact with his
mother Earth! And so death levels
all. only that liie may spring up in
new and more perfect forms.

The awful mystery of liie and
death. oi darkness and light. of good
and evil. we may not understand:
hut. we ltnow that where two lions
matched strength to strength and
died in combat. sprang up two lilies
fragrant and fair; and enriched by
the dead carcasses of savage beasts
they grew luxuriantly tall and bean-
tiful. 'l'hns does nature through
the mystery oi death effect the trans-
mutation of savageness and
strength into sweetness and beauty.
And thus do her analogies teach us.
that the evils and inharmonies oi the
present time shall combat each other
to death and through death trans-
ntute their undying forces into har-
monious iorms oi beauty. .-\nd so
shall the ﬂight of the arrow become
the spray of the iountain. the sweep
of the broad sword the song of the
circling scythe. the tumult oi war. the
shouting oi children at play 2"

We give this introduction oi the
president because it was so ﬁne of
itself and so impressive and effective
in its simple and modest delivery. In
his further remarks he dwelt on the
aﬁairs of the Republic. the prosper-
ity of the people and the lmsihilities
of the future. It was a splendid ado
dress of twenty or thirty minutes.
after which there was more music.
the reading of a poem composed by

— page 239

a local poet for the occasion and an
address by the burgomaster. There
were also remarks by a celebrated ac-
tor and the program closed with a
beautiful anthem by Prof. Hallam
and an invocation and benediction by
a venerable old gentleman yvho I
understood my countryman to say
was a Professor of Christian Philoso-
phy. At the conclusion of the exer-
cises Captain Brent and myself were
presented to the president and had a
few minutes of pleasant conversation
with him. He informed us that he
was made aware of our arrival in a
few minutes after we came ashore.
and would have telephoned his greet-
ing but that he anticipated the pleas-
ure of meeting us in a few hours.
He tendered Captain Brent and my-
self the freedom of the Republic and
invited us to accompany him to the
capital the next day. The invitation
was warmly seconded by Prof. Mor-
ris. who commanded tts to make ltis
house our home during the visit.
Being desirous above all things to
see the country. I accepted their in—
vitations and parted from them with
the understanding that I shoud meet
them at the ofﬁce of the affable
Director of Navigation the next
afternoon.

On our return to the vessel. Cap.
tain Brent and myself discussed the
situation thoroughly. and decided.
so far as the ship was concerned. to
leave every thing in statue quo for
the time being. I instructed him to
pay the crew up to date and without
cancelling articles. to give them all
shore leave for thirty days with the
privilege of going where they pleas-
ed in the country. or remaining on
the vessel at their option. He with

— page 239

the steward, was to remain on
board.

The next morning I went out to
look up a bank with the view of con-
\'erting some of my gold into money
of the realm. Failing to ﬁnd any
such institutions. or even to make
any one understand my wants. I had
recourse to my countryman. Prof.
Morris. who had been thoughtful
enough to give me his address the
night before. I informed him of my
desire. at which he looked grave and
asked me what my resources were.
I told him that I had money enough
to answer all my present wants. hav-
ing about 350.000 in American gold
in my safe aboard the vessel. and
that what I wanted was to ﬁnd a
sale bank where I could deposit it
and convert it into money of the
country as occasion should require.

“My dear sir." said the prolessor
seriously. “I fear your greatest dis-
appointment u-ith the country will be
when l enlighten you on the subject
oi your enquiry. Such things as
banks are unknown in the ﬁnancial
system of this country."

“But surely." said I. "there are
places of exchange where I can con-
vert American gold into the cur-
rency oi the country?"

"No." replied he. “for the simple
reason that gold is not money in this
country and is convertible into
money on the basis of its intrinsic
value. as' iron. coal and other com-
moditics are."

"I understand that." l interrupt-
ed. “and in that. your system is not
really diﬁ’erent from ours. Gold
money with us is based on the in-
trinsic value of the metal and there-
in diﬁ’crs from silver and other forms



— 240

of currency. That is the beauty of
the gold standard to which the Unit-
ed States is destined. There is no
artiﬁcial or 'liat' value inhering in it.
consequently it is worth as much in
any other country as it is in ours."
"Yes." replied the professor. with
a smile. "it is worth as much in any
other country where it is used for
money. but you must know my dear
sir that it is from its use as money.
that it derives its chief value. In this
country it is never used [or money
and its intrinsic value is only what it
derives from its utility in other re-
spects the same as tin. iron or cop-
per. It is not half so useful as any
at these. but it is much scarcer and is
relatively higher on that account.
Still. you must be terribly disap-
pointed when I tell you that what
was a handsome lortune for you in
America. is comparatively an insig-
niﬁcant sum in the Iron Republic.
There will not he the slightest trou-
hle though in converting it into
money of the realm and you need
have no hesitancy about doing it. as
you can reconvert it into gold at the
same rate any time. In other words
you can deposit it in the government
exchange. reuiviug its value in cur-
rency with the privilege of exchang-
ing the currency for gold again at
any time. Come." said he. “let us
go down and arrange it at once."
Going out we took a kind of horse-
less cab and soon alighted before. by
far. the largest building I had yet
seen. Rather I should say we alight-
ed in it.ior the streets passed through
the building. as did a number of rail-
roads. Uoing into an ofﬁce the pro-
fessor walked up to the counter and
asked the price of gold. The clerk

— 240
in charge handed out an ofﬁcial sheet
that looked like a market report and
with his pencil pointed to the quota-
tion of gold in the list. We learned
from this that it was worth two
diems (pronounced dayems.) per
pound. A simple calculation show-
ed my $50,000 of American coin to
be worth about $666. I was dum-
lounded. In a single moment I felt
a handsome fortune swept from my
hands. I actually cowered as from
a blow. My companion must have
noted it. for he slapped me on the
shoulder and rallied me.saying that
l was richer in the iron Republic
without a dollar titan I would be any
where else in the world with a mil-
lion. “Six hundred dollars! \\'hy."
said I desparingly. "that is not
enough to support me until I can
find worlr !”

"Why. my friend. that is enough
to keep you in comfort for several
years. And there is your vessel
worth 10.000 clients at least. enough
to make you a very rich man indeed
in this country."

After ascertaining the market
value of my gold it took but a short
time to have it brought to the gov-
ernment exchange and weighed in.
Before the metal was weighed in. the
clerk in charge asked me for my seal:
l in turn looked inquirineg and
rather helplessly to Prof. Morris.
who explained that l was not a citi-
zen and therefore had no seal. This
seemed likely to prove a fatal hitch
in the proceedings. for the clerk said
it was impossible for him to certify
me unless I had a seal. After con-
sultation it was arranged by having
l’rof. Morris deposit for me. It may
be supposed that l was an interested

—241

so entirely new and strange to me.
Drawing what appeared to he a disk
of hard rubber about the size of a
twenty-tire cent piece from his
purse. my friend dropped it into the
slot of a registering device attached
to the scales. the clerk in charge
pressed a lever and a small card iell
out along with the professor's seal.
placing the seal in his pocket l’rof.
Morris handed me the card. On one
side was a fac simiie of the seal. a cir-
cular ornamented border and within
these words. “W. A. Morris. Ameri-
can. citizen by grace. 1863." On the
reverse was stamped in ﬁgures that
cut into the card. the exact weight
of the metal.

The entire business was transact-
ed without the agent oi the govern-
ment ever touching the gold or the
receipt for it. From the scales the
metal was passed to the assayer
near by. who put a stamp under the
weight. indicating its ﬁneness and
then it was tagged and carried to a
vault-like stateroom. Passing to an-
other department. (for the place was
arranged similar to a great bank.)
the professor laid down his card and
had counted out to him a pile of
bills something like hank checks.
(ruled crossways on the hack ‘to
hold many signatures). aggregating
654 diems. the alloy in the gold malt-
ing it worth I: diems less than the
quoted price. These bills were hand-
ed over to me and the business was
completed. The whole transaction
consumed scarcely more time than
it takes to describe it and we went
from there to the Marine (mice
where we met the president. and
the three of us lunched with the Di-

— 241

rector of Navigation at a hotel. .\t
two o'clock we repaired to the stao
tion to take the ears for the capital
of the republic. The president and
Prof. Morris were recognized and
greeted courteoust by almost every
one we met. but there was no grovelo
ing or sycophaney. 1 could scarcely
realize that l was in the company at
the president of a great nation. so
simple and unpretentious were his
manners and carriage. He carried
his own carpet hag in his hand and
seemed to expect no more deference
than anybody else.

Prof. Morris purchased tny ticket
for me and we sat down with a num-
ber of others in a comfortable wait-
ing room and in a few minutes a
porter came in and announced that
the "Capital City express" was wait-
ing. We went through a gate where
our tickets were taken up and patle
into the cars. These ears were lour
feet wide. six feet high and twenty-
four feet long. The seats extended
entirely across the ear and there was
no provision made for walking ahout
in the coach. lletween every two
seats. p'aced to face each other. a
door opened from the side. So that
they were practically compartment
cars with room in each compartment
for four persons. There were a
dozen or ﬁfteen oi these car- in the
train. httt no locomotive. engineer or
Conductor was in sight. I noticed
that the end of the car at the front
of the train was pointed like the how
of a boat and when the passengers
were ushered into the ears the doors
were all locked from the onl-idc. .\

but will not be injected into this nar-
rative. as it would doubtless he tedi-
ous to the lay reader. In order
though that my reader may better
understand the plan of the cars I
have been describing, I will state
that this railroad was an elevated ai-
iair. massive iron pillars set m the
ground like those on which are ‘aid
the elevated railroads of New York.
There was no heat y superstructure

ways. the tracks or girdets on which
the cars run. being placed. one at the

average about tett l'ee‘. it'mtt the
ground. On account ol depressions
they sometimes ran cmtsiderably
higher. but newr iess than ten iect
over a road or lower Iltan sis feet
any where. Thus they could coo
counter no obstacles and were so
attached to the track that they could
not ﬂy til? even if the wheels on
which tltey ran were broken or de-
tached. The railway was double
tracked. that is there were two
sets of tracks. one on either side
of the upright iron pillars aml the
cars on oplmsite sides. ran in oppo-
site directions. so they cottld never

ed this novel railway \\ ere set about

an American elevated road and as
they took up scarcely any roont and
required no right oi way. the road

out dangcr or int'onvenicnce to any
body. The freight cars. of which I

change. were simply iron cylinders
of ahont the same size as the passen-
ger cars. The passenger trains were
run in the day time and the freight
trains at night. This description ap-

pnlilic. except some roads which

In a few moments after the host-
ling porter ushered us into our com-
partment. we started off with a gen-
tle ntotion which increased tttttil
within less than two minutes. we

than anything else. The president
and [’rol. Morris endeavored to draw
me into conversation. but a laintness
and dizziness came over tne so pros-
trating that I seemed on the verge
of collapse.

I struggled against it and brought
to bear all the force oi will I possess-
ed. but the fearful speed completely
unnerved me. The cars being ele-
vated above the ground and the win-
dows but little below the level of
the eye. we could only see the land-
scape at some distance and as it ﬂew
by I felt as if I were imprisoned in
a great cannon. hall being tired
through space. Cold perspiration
broke out on me and try as I might.
it was impossible for me to conceal
my distress. It was not fear. for I
knew from the construction of the
cars and road that an accident was
reasonably impossible and l was as-
sured by my companions that a la-
tal accident had never occurred on
the road. It was only the smooth.
noiseless. terrible speed that aﬂected
me and within an hour it wore at?
and I was myself again and began to
take a lively interest in the country
through which we were passing. .-\s
we sped on through great tracts of
country covered with farms. towns
and villages. over great rivers. across
hills and valleys. it made a ﬂying

not noticed any suggestion of aerial

Morris told me that if I had been in
the suburbs. I would have seen bun-
dreds of people out every tine after-
noon ﬂying for pleasure.

I was not surprised to see the air
navigated. for I had long been of
the opinion that it was only a matter
of time when the feat would be ac-
complished in America. I was sur-
prised though at the simplicity of
the flying machines. I haul been ac-
customed to think of a practical tly-
ing machine as something very com-

the muscles of the tlyers.

It all seemed so easily and grace-
fully done that I could not help won-
dering that people were not flying
the world over.

“How is it." I asked tny compan-
ions. "that people here seem to do
so easily what we have labored vain-
ly so many years in my country to
accomplish? Are you stronger. or
is the atmosphere more dense?"

"Neither one nor the other." an-
swered Prof. Morris. “You people

— 244

way. or had. up to the time I left the
country. You have been swallowed
up with the idea of machinery. You

.\ moment‘s reﬂection convinced
me that the profefs'sor was right and
during the entire trip nothing inter-
ested me so much as to watch the
graceful tlyers of whom there were
nearly always some in View.

I enquired if there were not a
very great many casualities resulting
front such hazardous exercises and
was informed that there were none
at all. That if any thing should hap-

aeroplane would let him down to
earth as gently as a parachute and
without danger. Seeing how ah-
sorhed l was with the outside view
and appreciating my curiosity. my
companions very considerately left
me to myself for the most part of the
journey. while they discussed mat-
ters of interest to the country at
large. We arrived at the capital at
six o'clock. making the 700 miles in
four hours and twenty-ﬁve minutes.

When we reached our destination
and the train stopped. the doors
were opened for the ﬁrst time since
we started and descending we found
ourselves in a large vaulted rmm
surrounded by all the hustle incident
to a great and prosperous city. Prof.
Morris called a carriage and parting
from President Wilkes (who cordial-
ly invited me to call on him at the
executive department.) we took our
seats and were driven—or propelled
rather. through wide tree-bordered
streets to the Professor's home in
the suburbs. Being hut a dull prac-
tical clod. language fails me to de-
scrihe the feelings and impressions
of that hour. The streets were liril-
liantly lighted and were ﬁlled with
gaily dressed people. some walking.
some riding in carriages or on bicy-
cles. some standing in knots about
the corners or sitting on rustic iron
seats under the trees along the curl).
and nothwithstanding the great con-
course there was no noise except the
laughter and conversation of the
maple. .\s in Corinthus. there was
not a horse to be seen. all of the
cmiveyances heing self-propelling.
The light and glamour. the beautiful
costumes. the noiseless. swiftly mov-

of fairy land. in the delightful home
of my countryman and patron. there
was not so much to remind me that
l was in a strange country. The
decorations and inmishings were
not so dilierent from that of the
best houses in America. except that
besides real works of art there seem-
ed to he a strict adherence to the
rule that every thing that was there
was there for use. There was no
piling up of heterogenious and con.
glomerate masses of trumpery such
as is to he found in many so-cailed
fashionable houses of America under
the general term of hric-a-hac. The
general style of furnishing was some-
thing hetween American luxurious-
ness and Japenese simplicity and
utility. The room into which i was
ushered seemed to he a parlor. li-
Mary and general receiving room all
in one and was warmed hy electric-
ity. but that cheerful glow which the
sight of a ruddy lire imparts. was oh-
tained by having an open grate piled
with unconsiimalrle fagots that blaz-
ed white and red when the current
was turned on. A handsome instru-
ment reaching almost to the ceiling
land which I afterwards found to he
a combination pipe organ and grand
piano.) stood in one corner and by
it a music rack piled with what ap-
peared to he a great variety of
music.

After conducting me into this
room and requesting me to make
myself at home. my host stepped to
the mantel over which was a trans-
mitter something like what I had
seen in the ofﬁce of the Director of
Navigation at Corinthus. and pulled
out a stop. whereupon in tones sweet

— 245

and rich. but soft and low the most
beautiful orchestral music seemed to
float in and fill the room. He then
excused himself and withdrew saying
that he would rejoin me directly.

I was so charmed with the music
that sounded like the far off strains
of some grand orchestra . that I
made no note of time and was only
recalled to my surroundings when
l‘rof. Morris advanced into the room
leading a handsome woman of mid-
dle age who he introduced to me as
his wife. Extending her hand she
greeted me most cordially. ‘while
the Professor shut off the music.)
welcoming me to her country and
particularly to her home. I ac-
knowledged her courtesy in the best
language I was ahle to command
and expressed my sincere and heart-
felt gratitude for the wanu welcome
I had received from every one I had
met. especially from herself and gen-
erous husliand. .\l y hostess was
dressed in a house gown. or kind of
wrapper. and was certainly a very
prelxissessing woman. \\'ith a most
engaging smile she assured me that
in meeting a countryman of her hus-
band's she felt that she was meet-
ing a near relative and with a direct-
ness and simplicity that completely
captivated me. she expressed the
hope that I would reciprocate the
feeling. She also insisted—and in
this she was joined by her husband.
that I should make their house my
home all the time and any time that
I was in the capital.

.\s I had had but little time to
talk with my host hefore. the ccinver-
sation naturally turned to the world
we had left and especially to our na-
tive Country. I hrielly outlined the

— 246

course of events from the time he
left the l'nited States down to the
present. In all this as may he sup-
posed. he was deeply interested and
his ehanning wife eppeared to he not
less so. The civil war was in pro-
gress when he left .\merica and it
was with great satisfaction he learn-
ed that the Union had been preserv-
ed and loyal friendship again estab-
lished between the states. He in-
formed the that he was a young oi-
tieer in the navy when the war
hrolte out. but being of southern
birth he could not take up arms
against his native state and at the
same time he was too loyal to array
hitnsell against the federal govern-
ment. .\s a way out of it he resign-
ed and being: quite wealthy he pur-
chased and manned a vessel. and hav-
ing long cherished a desire for po-
lar exploration. resolved to spend
the period during which the war was
being waged. in a Voyage to the Aut-
artie regions. Like myself. he had
fottnd the passage through the ice
barriers and sailed down to the coast
of the iron Repuhlic. .\s he was fa-
miliar with the history of the world
and particularly that of the United
States down to INN when he left it.
and as the wonderful country in
which I found myself was as new to
me as if it had been located on Jupi-
ter of Mars. there was of course far
more for me to learn than to tell.
lint as I knew how great his inter-
est must he in the world he had left
more than thirty years hefore and
had never heard from since. I fore-
bort- asking any questions concern-
ing his adopted country until I had
imparted to him as thorough a
kllﬂuit‘tige as possible of what had


— 246

taken place in the old world since he
left it.

.\s I warmed up in this endeavor.
inspired by the eager interest of both
my host and his wife.—who listened
with rapt attention. I was interrupt.
ed by the rustling of a portiere be-
hind and turning. I saw a vision of
Ioveliuess that drove the whoIe sub-
ject front my mind and so confused
me that as I rose to be introduced. I
hesitated and stammered like a
sehool boy. There. framed by the
arched doorway. with one hand rais-
ed to push aside the portiere. was a
picture to rattle the most stolid and
indifferent son of Adam. (You su-
how naturally I fall back into the
American vernacular.) Tall. fair with
a wealth of golden brown hair coil-
ed like a turban on the crown of a
magniﬁcently poised head. I beheld
standing before me the most splen-
did woman tbat I had ever gazed
upon.’ Large brown eyes beaming
with intelligence. milk white fore-
head broad and low. a ﬁrm mouth.
exquisiter chiseled with full ruby
lips. a well rounded chin. strong. but
relieved by a most charming dimple.
perfect teeth and snow white. as I
observed when she smiled a most
gracious welcome. such was Helen
Morris. the daughter of the house.
as she appeared to me the ﬁrst time.
I had always been proud of Ameri-
ca's beautiful women. of whom I had
known many. but never before had I
looked upon a woman that so im-
pressed. or I should rather say. over-
whelmed me. She was richly attired
in the evening dress of that country
which heightened the charm of her
queenly face and ﬁgure. She wore a
close ﬁtting bodice of light blue silk

—247

that displayed to perfection the ex-
quisitely rounded bust and well form-
ed waist and extended just high
enough to be caught with a pearl
shell ornament like an epaulet over
the shoulders. Above this was set a
rich lace collar or yoke. of a delicate
peach blow tint which served to em-
phasize the whiteness of the alabas-
ter throat. close ﬁtting sleeves of the
same stutf revealed. rather than hid.
the beautifully moulded arms. end-
ing with large rnﬂles at the wrists.
.\round the waist was belted a skirt
of seal brown velvet extending half
way to the knees and under this was
worn a close fitting knitted garment
of dove colored silk that terminated
in seal colored buskins fastened with
light blue pearl buttons around the
shaper ankle. She looked like a
heautiful prinia donua before the
footlights in full stage costume.
every perfection' of form and fea-
ture was dispiayed to the greatest
Iumlible advantage and as she ad.
vanced with natural and unstudied
grace. I could not but remark how
much more beautiful (iod's most ex-
quisite creation appeared in this garb
than in the starched and stilted
skirts as I had been accustomed to
seeing them all my life.

She also greeted me cordially and
though too polite to appear to no-
tice it. with a swwping glance she
took in my costume and l imagined
that I could detect a smile lurking in
the corners of her mouth. To a per-
son who had never before seen a
man attired in baggy legged trous-
ers that dragged the tloor and high
glazed collar that cut the chin. I. no
doubt. presented quite a ludicrous
appearance. As I contrasted myself

—247

with her lather. gracefully dressed in
the old English fashion of knee
hreeches and rnﬂles. I cottch not hot
perceive that it was to my disadvan-
tage. Alter the exchange of a few
pleasant civilities in which I was as
ntnch charmed with the music oi lter
voice as I had been with the luauty
of her person. she announced that
the evening meal was waiting and
taking her father's arm led the way
to the dining room leaving me to es-
cort .\lrs. Morris. or rather to he es-
corted hy her.

The dining room. or kitchen. for
it was all in one. was a cozy room
with polished stone tloor and at one
eml was what appeared to he a low
enameled sidehoard. though I found
when the meal was served that it was
an electric furnace from which the
diﬂ'erent dishes were taken and set
ttpon the marble topped tahle. Every
thing was served irom the dish in
which it was cooked and I learned
for the ﬁrst time that culinary op.
erations could he carried on without
soot or smoke.

The cooking vessels were set upon
paper mats and under each plate
was spread a snow white paper nap-
kin while another. neatly folded lay
heside it. At the risk of being tire~
some I am going thus minutely into
these details. ttty object heing to
give as clearly as possible an insight
into the way these people live. It is
with the hope too. that overworked
American women whose lives are
one long martyrdom to the wash
tnh. the dish pan and the ironing
tahle. may proﬁt by the simpler and
cleanlier customs of a more advanc-
etl people. Knowing what .\nterican
customs were. my host remarked to

— 249

me that there was enough necessary
labor in the Iron Republic to keep
everybody employed and so no un~
necessary labor was indulged in.

.\'0 table cloths or napkins were
laundried. the paper ones used being
fully as good and so cheap that the
cost was a mere nothing. Even
these. after being used were packed
in a hamper and exchanged for new
ones at half the original cost. They
were chemically cleansed and went
into pulp again at the factory and so
were used over and over.

The professor and his wife sat op-
posite to each other at the table.
which placed me ris-a-vis to the
charming daughter. I had been ac-
customed to social functions of every
description and no Beau Brununell
was ever more at home at a fashion-
able dinner party than I. But with
this beautiful woman directly in front
of me. her radiant face only a few
feet from mine and our knees almost
touching under the table. I was as
awkward as a country bumpltin at a
Lord Mayor‘s banquet.

They were all kind enough I think.
to attribute this to the strangeness
of my surroundings and in most
gracious ways strove to relieve me of
my embarrassment and make me
feel at home. During the meal hour.
which was a most delightful one. we
talked about American customs and
then the conversation turned upon
American art and literature. in com-
parison with that of the Iron Repub-
.lic. In the discussion which followed
l was pitted against the ladies. My
host remarking that as be was a
citizen of both countries he should
be equally proud of the achievements
of each. I dilated on our poets. es-

achievements of our architects and
painters: but whether it was the su-
perior numbers of the enemy or su-
perior strategic ability. tny native
country was made to appear as iar
behind in these as in the mom prac-
tical arts of life. The best oi the old

bore him to his adopted country.
Emerson. Longfellow. Whittier and
many other American writers they
were also familiar with as the profes-
sor had brought their earlier works
to the country and all had been re-
published and put through many
editions. Finally. turning to my host.
I said lnnteringly. "Professor. if

qualiﬁes you for participating in this
discussimt or taking sides. it ought
to ﬁt you all the better to act as rel-
eree between us. You are iamiliar

and to your judgment I am willing to
defer: Now. upon the lines we have
been debating. which country in
your opinion. is entitled to take pre-
cetlence P"

"This." said the professor alter a
moment‘s hesitation. “is a difﬁcult
question to answer. To institute a
comparison of this kind. is like com-
paring one part of the ﬁrmament to
the other. Every nation has pro~
duced its great men—men who were

of the lirmament has stars as bright
as any other part. The human mind
has its limitations and probably some
men of every race have risen to the
limit oi human achievement in some
things. But while all parts of the

left the table.

On our return to the aitting room
my host excused himself saying that
he had same business aﬁairs to lnrtlt

immediately afterwards Mrs. Morris
