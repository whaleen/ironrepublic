## CHAPTER 3

(“ILI "RE "I.

The apprehensions of Captain
Brent proved groundless. The pay
sage was open and though there was
considerable ﬂoating ice. the current
was driving it in the same direction
and we experienced no ditiiculty in

— page 153

sailing through. Indeed it was im-
pmsihle for us to do anything but
go through. for after we had gotten
fairly into the strait the current was
like a mighty. swift. ﬂowing river
and had there been a fair wind to go
back it must have blown half a gale
to drive us against such a tide as was
sweeping through. I was convinced
that this was a permanent strait and
not merely an accidental break in
the great barriers. The regular
smoothness of the sides showed the

— page 153

effects of a continuous current and
the abrasions of great masses of ice
carried through by it. I say I was
convinced then: hut when on our re-
turn we found the passage in every
rc~pect practically in the same Cull-
tiition as when we passed through
“N. there was positively no room
lor doubt. I will not contend that
this xtrait is always open. but I do
maintain that it is a permanent chan-

in these wild sea wastes are very
cautious. seldom approaching near
enough to the barriers to detect this
passage even if it were open. \\'hat
the depth of it is we had no means
of ascertaining. for though we splic-

the length of the passage to be about
twenty ﬁve miles. ()n the farther
side the ice walls and uea presented
practically the same features as on
this. the shining clili‘s running away
as far as the eye could see on either
hand. while the black ocean heaved
with great hillows that broke with
continuous thunder against the bar-
riers or threw their spray high up on
the great solemn icebergs that ﬁnal-
ed in silent majesty. too immense to
be shaken by Neptune in the wildest
efforts of his wrath.

The sun. which had been rising but
a little way above the horizon for
some time past. disappeared entirely
soon after We got into the open sea
beyond the barriers. but when the
air was not ﬁlled with sleet or snow.
it was never really dark. The aurora
australis too. frequently lighted the
sea with its wierd strange glow so
that it was easy for us to keep the
irozcn coast line in view. My object
was now to circumnavigate this polar
Sea. Sailing eastward alongr the

again came in view of Mount Erebus

headed the ship due south and soon

My idea then was that we were
in an open polar sea. ice locked all
around and we thought to sail di-

barriers on the opposite side and
thus obtain a knowledge of its ex-
tent.

weather was fair and we detected
this by the constellations or we
would nndotthtedly have sailed out
of our course and tttrned the ship
around in following the compass.
l-‘or weeks alter we passed through
"Harrington Strait" (as l have been
egotistical enough to christen it.» we
had storms. snow and ice and the
black ocean through which we
ploughed was in no wise ditl'erent

Horn to Victoria Land. except that
we noticed less ice and met with no
storms as severe as we encountered
on this side. both going and coming.
I will not weary the reader with the
details of our long voyage in this
hitherto unknown .ocean. In the
course of time the sun again appear-
ed and as we drew southward the
sea became cleared of ice and the
cold moderated as it does in travel-
ing from the poles to the equator.
ln rain we looked for the ice barriers
which we supposed surrounded us:
only the black open sea stretched on
and we held our course. There were

— page 155

no exciting incidents and four
month after passing the barriers. we
were sailing in open seas out of the
region of ice and snow with the
weather constantly growing warmer.
Two months later we encountered
driit wood and not long afterwards
seaiowls appeared and grew won
numerous every day. They ﬁrst ap-
peared on the starboard side, and as
their number increased from day to
day including some that were un-
mistakably land birds. I expressed
the opinion to Captain Brent that
we were sailing parallci to some coast
and suggested that the ship's course
be altered to make this shore. This
was done and evidences of land such
as seaweed and driitwood became
more apparent every da’v.

My interest and excitement be-
came so great that I could not be
still a moment when awake and could
sleep but little. In a lever oi rest-
lessness I walked the deck hour after
hour and scanned the horizon (or
land ta perfectly useless waste oi en-
ergy. as a man was stationed in the
lookout. who of course would see
the land long before it became visible
from the deck.) The weather was
ﬁne and we were evidently nearing
land of some kind.

.\s night closed on the 20th of
July. an. illumination of some kind
was plainly visible on the horizon of
the starboard how and the vessel‘s
head was turned towards it. My
excitement was so great that I did
tmt go down to my cabin for supper.
The illumination grew plainer con-
stantly. and at ten o‘clock the look-
out at the mast head said he could
distinguish what seemed to be elec-
tric lights. At this my hopes fell. 1
had been thrilled with the idea of

— page 155

approaching an unknown land in an
unknown ocean. and now it seemed
that in some way we had gotten hack
into the beaten track of the world
and was approaching a modern city.
Captain Brent was of the opinion
that it was one of the cities on the
west coast of South America. al-
though it was impossible to under-
stand how we could have gotten
there as we had been sailing south

polar regions. In a short time it was
plainly to be seen from the deck that
we were approaching a considerable
city. lighted hv electricity. .\s we
neared the land the lead was heaved
constantly and alter running in as
close as he dared. the captain cast
anchor and waited for daylight he-
fore attempting to enter the harbor.

As soon as the ship was made
snug and everything became quiet
on hoard. l was struck by the strange
silence of the city that lay before us.
Although evidently a large citv and
a modern one. lif we might judge
from the brilliant manner in which it
was lighted.) there was an entire ab-
sence of that roar and rumble which
characterizes the modern American
or European city. As a matter of
fact. although we lay within a few
miles. no sound of any kind came to
us and the silence was strange and
wiertl-like. as though it was some
brilliantly illuminated city of the
dead.

I was awakened next morning the
the creaking of the winch and the
rattling of the cable as the anchor
was hoisted, and dressing hurriedly
I went on deck where the captain
and crew were discussing the small
craft that was coming out of the
harbour. Even as we looked a most


— page 156

remarkable boat came tearing out
and pitching towards us at the rate
of at least ﬁfty miles an hour. .-\s it
came towards us we could see only
a great hillow of foam and above it
a covered deck something like a ferry
boat or excursion barge. When it
came alongside of us we could see
that the vessel. (if such a thing may
be called a vessel.) consisted of a
long cigar shaped hull submerged
after the fashion of the American
whalehack. with the superstructure
raised on stanchious. On each end
of this cylindrical hull were great
cone shaped screws somewhat larger
than the hull itself. and it was these
that raised the hillows of foam as
they leaped through the water. push-
ing and dragging the strange looking
boat. .\ uniformed pilot was put
aboard. attd a towing hawser

cent. the pilot asked what vessel it

ped his jaw. stretched his eyes and
looked altogether as upset as if he
had been told that it was the Flying
Dutchman.

"What land is this?" asked Cap-
tain Brent in turn.

"The Iron Republic. sir." replied
the pilot. again saluting. and advanc-
ing to the wheel. lu resptmse to our
further questioning. he courteonsly
stated that he was an ofﬁcer on duty.
that it was against the rules for him
to hold any conversation except in
reference to the ship and begged us
to curb our curiosity tmtil we got
ashore. when all the information we
desired would be afforded us.

— page 156

There was nothing else ior us to
do. so Captain Brent turned his at.
tention to lowering and iurling the
sails which had heen hoisted. and h}-
the time every thing was made mug.
we were alongside the pier.

.-\a soon as we were made iast an-
other oﬂicer came on hoard and he.
like the pilot. seemed to he dumb.
founded when he learned that the
\‘CSSC' hailed from the United Slales
of America. Alter inspecting the
ship's papers. he turned to Captain
Brent and inionned him that the en-
cumstances ol our arrival were so
unusual and unprecedented in his ex-
perience. that he would be under the
necessitv of conducting him to the
oﬂice oi the Director oi Navigation.
Thereupon. the captain introduced
me an owner and the proper perm:
to deal with. and the officer politely
requested me to accompany him.

“Sir.” said I. as we passed through
the curious throng that had gather-
ed on the wharf. “will you be kind
enough to tell me what country thix
is and in what part of the world it
lies ?"

"This." he replied. “is the Iron
Republic and the continent on which
von stand lies about as far from the
irozen ocean as your own continent
ol America does in the opposite di-
rection."

Just here. having reached the out-
skirts of the crowd. he made a signal
and a man approached with a horse-
less vehicle and distnottnting salut-
ed and opened the door ol‘ his car-
riage. Forltearing to question fur-
ther an otlicer of whose power and
authority I had not the slightest idea.
and whose extreme courtesy iorhade
impertinence. I took my place in the
carriage and was whirled along wide.

smooth streets through the heart of
the city. I have remarked that
though we lay just outside of the
harbor and in sight of the city for
sottte hours before entering. we
heard none of that roar and rnnthle
inseparahle from cities of its apparent
size among us. The reason was now
plain. In the first place the streets
were all as smooth as a tennis court
and there was nothing to make a
noise. There was ttot a horse to be
seen and it was evident from the
door-like cleanliness of the streets
that they were not intended for the
use of horses and wagons. On all
sides were horseless vehicles of every
description. from the lightest hi-
cyclcs to large covered vans. all rnh-
lncr tired. whirling to and fro swiftly
and without noise.

I had only time to note the things
referred to.and to remark the strange
and picturesque costumes of the
ladies and gentlemen who were on
the street. when my conductor drew
up before a large substantial stone
building covering an entire hlocla.
Stepping down front the carriage. he
assisted me to alight and ushered
me into a large and well lighted re-
ception room in the front of the
building. I noticed as we approached
that a hltte flag with a white star
ﬂoated from the tower on the roof.
and surmised that in some way the
two ofﬁcers with whom I had been
brought in contact and the building
which we had just entered. repre-
sented the same department of gov-
ernment. .

Conducting me to one of the cont-
fortahle seats with which the room
was supplied. my companion excus-
ed himself by saying that the gentle-
man who tnet me at the boat would

withdrew. Scareer had he passed
through the door when the person
referred to dune in. having presume
ably ridden up after us in his own
carriag . Smiling pleasantly. he ex-
pressed the hope that I would not he
annoyed by the little cmwentionali-
ties to which I was being subjected.
saying that my arrival was so estra-
ordinary and so out of common
with all other entries made since he
had been connected with the marine.
that he had no other recourse but to
refer me to the head of the depart-
meat. I assured him that l was under
obligations for his courteous atten-
tion: that a stranger as l was and
dazed hy the extraordinary circum.
stances in which I found myself. I
was in a condition to absolutely re-
quire guidance and direction.

He desired me to consider myself
under no restraint whatever. stating
that l was heing referred to the chief
of the llureau of Navigation. because
he was at a loss to know how to
place me on the marine register.
Opening a door he conducted me
without ceremony into the presence
of a gentleman whom he introduced
as "Director of Navigation and Chief
of the Department of the Marine."
This oﬂiccr. notwithstanding his evi-
dent high position. rose and smiling
cordially bowed and asked us hoth to
he seated. In a few words the snlinr~
dinate explained to his superior the
circumstances of my arrival and ask-
ed for instructions in certain matters
pertaining to the registering of my
vessel. These were given and then
the high oliicial with rare feeling and
tact arose and grasped my hand and
welcomed me to the Iron Republic:
saying that though it might lack the

— page 158

associations which must make my
native country pleasant. it possessed
advantages and attractions which he
believed. front what he had been able
to learn. cottld not he found in Amer-
ica. I thanked him for his cordial
greeting and assured him that while
some associations of my own coun'
try had been pleasant. others were
very unpleasant and upon the whole
I was glad to have found my way
to the "Iron Republic." whatever
and wherever it might he.

Mter inquiring into the details of
my voyage in which he manifested
great interest. the director remarked
that the astonishment of his country-
men at my arrival would naturally
be much less than mine. inasmuch
as they had a very thorough knowl-
edge of my country. It was known.
he said. front the settlement of his
country that the American conti-
nent existed: indeed that it was the
attempt of a ship load of emigrants
to get to America that led to the dis-
covery of the continent on which the
magniﬁcent structure ofgovermnent
known as the iron Repuhlic had
been reared. T his was in 1698. aml
driven southward by ﬁerce gales the
colonists after many months of bat-
tling with storm and ice. fouml them-
selves cast on the inhospitable shores
of a new world. For many years af-
ter the first settlement was made. it
was suplmsed by the colonists that
they were on a portion of the Ameri-
can continent. but with the develop
ment of the country. the increase of
knowledge aml the researches of
navigators. it was fouml that they
had heen discoverers as well as col-
univcrs. They knew all that was
kmmn in Human: of the American
Cuntincnt up to the time they were

— page 158

so effectually cut at? from the hal-
ance of the civilized world and with-
in the past fifty years two other
.\merican ships had drifted to their
shores. When l told him how many
lives had been lost and how much
treasure had been squandered by
America and other nations in Artie
explorations. and expressed surprise
that a people so advanced in the arts
of civilization as his nation appeared
to he. should make no attempts to
establish communication with other
parts of the world. but should remain
isolated for centuries. he smiled
pleasantly and said he could appre-
ciate my feelings.

In the ﬁrst place he explained that
the Iron Republic had never been
engaged in maritime connneree to
any considerable extent even in the
days when trading was encouraged.
as there were no other great mari-
time nations to trade with. as a con-
sequence there was not that passion
for voyaging and exploration. which
obtains among a maritime people.
Nevertheless. some attempts had
been made to get through the bar-
riers and as vessels had sailed away
and never returned. it was supposed
at the time. that some of them might
have succeeded in the attempt. Since
the establishment of the great repub-
lic though. no eﬁorts had been made
in that direction for the reason that
there was not sufficient private cap-
ital to undertake such enterprises
and from the knowledge they had
of the outside world. the government
did not desire cl0ser intercourse
with the older nations as it could not
possibly do them any good and
might result in much hami. This. he
admitted. was a species of national
selﬁshness: "hut selﬁshness." said he.

— page 159

with a smile. "is human and is one
thing we have in common with all
peoples past and present." He then
told me that a Captain Morris had
reached their country with a ship
and crew during the progress of the
great civil war and that some years
before that an old American whaler
had come to their shores. The whaler
remained with them a year and then
left with the intention oi making his
way back to America and was never
heard of again. Ca tain Morris. he
informed me. was t en in the coun-
try and being a man oi great ability
was at the head oi the government
naval college. The most of his crew,
too. were still living and were estab-
Iishetl in different parts of the coun-
trv.

'At the conclusion of an hour at
pleasant conversation the aﬂahle Di-
rector touched a hutton. saying that
it was very probable that the press
had given out the details of my ar-
rival. Speaking into a bell-shaped
transmitter directly over his table
he called "current news." and then
pushed back his chair in a listening
attitude.

In a moment a voice. rich. strong
and distinct. answered hack through
the transmitter. "Current news !"—

“Special resume at 1.: o'clock."

The voice ceased and touching tltc
button again. the director turtted to
me. I have not given all. or anything
like half what came to us as current
news, lntt just simply a sample. I etu-
qnired if this news was heing read
from a dail_v paper through the tel.

it was the paper tor what corre-
sponded to it) itself. .

"Do you mean to say." I asked
with astonishment. “that all of the
people get the news as we ltave just
heard it ?"

“I mean to say." answered tlt div
rector. "that several millions of peo-
ple heard or had the opportunity of
hearing the same voice. giving out
the same news that we have just list—
ened to."

".\ttd there is no paper printed ?" I

asked. scarcely able to grasp the idea
of melt in news' service.

".\' one except what is primed right

I had noticed ticking on the table.)

produced there in print and can be

stroyed at the option of the patron."
I stepped to the table and looked.
but could make nothing of the cahao
listic signs on the paper before me.
"llow is it." I enquired. “that you
speak the English language and do
not use the Roman characters as oth-
er linglish speaking people do?"

'°\\'e used the saute letters." ans-
wered the director. "until the dis-

"What do you call a sound char-
acter?" i asked.

"I may not be able to make you
understand." said the director. "if
you are unfamiliar with the develop-
ment and progress of the knowledge
of sound." I told him that the nature
of sound as atmospheric vibrations
was well understood by us and meu’
tionedthe telephone and phonograph
in common use as an illustration.
“Very well then." said he. “it is sim-
ple enough. The vibrations are com
municated to the machine and the
machine transmutes them into char-
acters. Reproduce a sound a million
times and it will make the same char-
acter every time. It is a true phonet-
ic system and is Nature's own writ-
ing."

Amazed at a civilization evidently
so far in advance of ours. I had for-
gotten the circtnnstances by which

— page 161

l was surrounded and would have
questioned further. but the genial of-
ticial excused himself. saying that his
duties would deprive him of the fur-
ther pleasure of my company at that
time. but that he hoped to meet me
again smut. outside of business hours
and in a social way. In the mean-
time. I would receive the attention of
the government. Pressing another

and returned to the whari. .-\s l ap-
proached. in the conduct of the same
ofﬁcer who had carried me from the
hunt. the curious crowd fell back re-
spectfully and I passed on hoard.
Notwithstanding our position was
one calculated to repress every emo-
tion except astonishment. I found

of wrath and the steward was de-

found that the last named dignitary
had been out in the city trying to
purchase fresh meats and vegetables,
of which the men stood in great need
after their long voyage. It seemed
though. that neither gold or silver
would he accepted in payment and
so the dinner of freth victnals that
all had looked forward to so eager-
ly. was not in sight. We were soon
relieved. however. by the appearance
of a van load of fresh supplies. which
the vendor said was brought on an
order from the Marine oliice.

I retired to my cabin and tried to
collect my thoughts. I had been hut
a few hours in this wonderful coun-
try and already my senses had taken
in more. it seemed to me. than my
mind could analyze and digest in
weeks. i felt as if I would like to get
away by myself for two or three
days and think it over. Everything
was so new and strange. that all
mental effort was directed to grasp-
ing the situation.
