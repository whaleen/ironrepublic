# Chapter 5

When we left the ladies and passed into the library, my host informed me that he was at my service for the day and would take pleasure in showing me about the city, which besides being the capital, was one of the most beautiful in the republic. “I have ordered a carriage which will be here in a few minutes,” he said, “and we will, if you please, devote the forenoon to an inspection of our principal public buildings. This afternoon we can take a general view of the city. And now,” he continued, “if you will consent to wear a suit of my clothes until you can have a tailor supply you, I think it will save you some annoyance. The unusual style of your dress must attract attention and it is not pleasant to be the centre of interest for the curious crowd.”
 
I thanked him and availing myself of his kind offer, went up to my room and made the change. As we were of about the same size and proportions, the clothes fitted me admirably, and though I felt at first like a baseball player or Richelieu at a masquerade, I was far more comfortable than I would have been in my own outlandish garb. Taking our places in a kind of motor carriage or landeau that had arrived, we were whirled rapidly through many beautiful streets and squares to the capitol. This magnificent building of which I have a number of photographs on board of my vessel, is modeled after the Roman Pantheon but much larger. Also instead of one, there are four columned entrances of white and blue marble, that rose to the height of the dome and then from a richly ornamented fringe broke away into moorish towers of great beauty. Each of these entrances was a building of itself and above the pillared rotunda which forms an entrance to the auditorium under the great dome, are several stories divided into offices for the different departments of the government. From the second floor, each of these opened into a passageway on a great gallery that ran entirely around the auditorium and thus they were connected above the ground and within the building. Passing into one of these great vestibules, we ascended a broad stairway on one side of the gallery, from which my friend said a better view could be had of the great auditorium. There were elevators on the other side, but as we were only going up to the first floor, we took the stair.

Any adequate description of this magnificent place as it appeared to me when we walked out on the broad gallery is beyond my powers. The auditorium, I was informed, is two hundred feet in diameter beneath the dome, making the circuit of the gallery on which we stood about six hundred feet. This balcony was supported all around on graceful columns and surmounted by a heavy bronze balustrade, which is a rare work of art. On the floor of this immense amphitheater, was a platform or arena, some fifty feet in diameter, enclosed with a railing and furnished with chairs and desks for the use of the members of the National Assembly. These were rolled to the back of the platform as the place had been used for a concert the night before and I immediately recognised it as the place I had seen in miniature. From this platform, the seats in the auditorium extended back to, and under the broad gallery that ran around the walls making, with the balcony, the professor informed me, a seating capacity for about fifteen thousand persons. The seats in the body of the auditorium were built of marble with numerous aisles leading down, while those on the balcony were of bronze.

Around the entire amphitheater, where the great dome sprang from the supporting walls, was a heavy gilded cornice supported by ornate capitals resting on pillars in bas-relief that extended to the floor of the balcony. Between this cornice and a heavy gild mould a few feet under it was the National picture gallery, where portraits of presidents and notables of the republic, in every field of effort. Only a small part of this space had been consumed and I was informed that if the present high grade of eligibility was maintained, it would require at least a thousand years to fill this gallery. I was assured that to get one's portrait in this place was a greater distinction than it was to have been crowned victor in the ancient Olympian Games, or to be buried in Westminster Abbey.

Above the cornice, was undoubtedly the most magnificent and artistic frieze ever created by the hand of man. Over a ground work of rolling cloud masses, black and storm driven, that was piled around the circle of this grand cornice like a horizon, were pictures representing in allegory the history of the nation. Even if I were capable, the poverty of our language forbids an adequate description of this amazing work of art. The first picture was a ship leaving an old world city with all the attendant scenes that could portray the emotions of friends and kindred in the act of parting. The next was the same ship lone and wave beaten fighting its way through the icebergs of a polar sea. In the next the voyagers are landing with thanksgiving on a new found land. And so it went on, the wonderful pictures all trending in the same direction with the storm driven clouds and illustrating pioneer life, agriculture, art, science, religion and war and making an historical panorama which it would require days and even weeks to properly study and appreciate.

“And have you had wars in this country?" I asked as my eye rested on a most realistic scene of fire and carnage.

“The most cruel and horrible perhaps of any nation in modern times," answered my friend. “That was before my arrival in the country, but the very ground on which this building stands has been soaked in human blood and piled with the mangled bodies of the slain. The present order, so far removed from even the contingency of war, was by no means a bloodless achievement as you will find when you have time to read the history of the country," Above the frieze which I have been trying to describe, was a beautiful and artistic border of angels flying swiftly in the direction indicated by the development of the allegorical procession below. From this to the zenith, the great sky-blue dome was relieved with dashes of flecks of cloud in representation of the firmament, with here and there an airy picture from the ancient mythology. It was lighted by many windows, but they were covered with glass so exactly tinted to match the surface in which they were set that they were scarcely distinguishable. The whole interior surface was set with electric jets, which by night appeared like stars shining in the sky. This was the chamber of deputies and though the National Assembly was not in session, it was open, as indeed, I was informed that it stood open to the public always, night and day and was one of the attractions of the capitol to visitors. Quite a number of people, evidently strangers, were scattered about the auditorium, singly or in groups, admiring and descanting on the beauties of the place. I noticed, too, several ladies and gentlemen, apparently art students, who had their easels set at different places on the balcony and were engaged in copying pictures from the frieze. Standing within the railing of the platform, a janitor was demonstrating by some experiments, the remarkable acoustic qualities of the place. Tapping a desk with a gavel, (which sounded in the gallery like the report of a six-pounder, he requested us all to stand still for a moment and then he snapped his fingers and the sound came to the furtherest gallery as distinctly as the crack of a whip. Next, he whispered a sentence, which was perfectly audible, and then he took up a pen and wrote a line on a sheet of paper lying on a desk. The scratching of the pen could be heard to the remotest seat more than a hundred feet away. I remarked to my guide that the debates here must be of a very exciting character to require so large an auditorium, especially as every word spoken here could be heard by the people in their homes. In reply, he told me that they were exciting sometimes, but the most interesting events and those that drew the largest audiences were when distinguished men of national reputation came to claim “privilege.” To make me understand this, he explained that any person, man or woman, at the request of the deputy from their province, by recommendation of their Commonwealth Assembly or on a petition signed by one thousand citizens, could claim the privilege of this floor to speak on any measure of public policy, the same as if he were a national senator. On occasions when men of great fame came here to discuss questions of importance, the vast auditorium was filled to its utmost capacity. Also at the inauguration of presidents, the people came in great numbers from all parts of the country. As a matter of fact I was told that during the sessions there was always people enough to make a large audience.

After taking in the auditorium we passed into other parts of the great building where were the different departments of the government. We went through the departments of “Justice," “Agriculture," “Transportation and Public Utilities," “Subsistence," “Finance" and “Progression." The last was really a department of internal improvement, corresponding somewhat to our department of the interior. There was no departments of state, war or navy. The Post Office Department was one of the largest and was in a separate building, as the postal system there includes a species of banking and express.

After going through the capitol, we inspected several other fine public buildings situated in the “Capitol Square," a large park-like area which was laid off with trees, shrubs and flowers and adorned with fountains and statuary. In a paved court facing the main entrance to the capitol was a circular monument or pillar of solid iron, thirty feet high and ten or twelve feet in diameter on which stood a colossal bronze statue of what was apparently a working man with a sledge hammer thrown back in the attitude of striking a blow. A bronze scroll on the face of the pillar was inscribed with the words, “The state was made for man, and not man for the state." The statue, the professor told me, was of a blacksmith named Adam Holt, who was the real founder of the republic, and the pillar was cast entirely of the cannon, which had been used in the Great War that preceded its establishment. Every president who was inaugurated took the oath of office, I was told, with his hand on the pillar, and his first official utterance was to declare in the hearing of the people, the words of the scroll.

We went through the National Conservatory of Music, The Historical Museum, The Marine College, (of which my host was the head), and the National college of Experimental Sciences. Everywhere my companion was received with the greatest courtesy and seemed to be held in the highest esteem.

I entered the conservatory with an interest enhanced by what I had heard of its talented president and recognised him at once from having seen him on the stage at Corinthus. My first glance, when I was introduced to him showed me that I was in the presence of that sporadic production of nature that we call genius. He was a young man but prematurely bald and a decided stoop made him appear short, though he was really of medium height. A fringe of light brown hair clustered around his large head and his complexion was as fair as that of Helen Morris. His eyes were blue and rather watery and impressed me, even when he was speaking to me, with the idea that he was listening to something afar off. Apparently he had never shaved, for the scant brown beard, that grew upon his face was as fine as a woman's hair. When I expressed my high appreciation of his musical production of that morning and told him how his accomplishments had been lauded by his fair pupil, he smiled in a pleased way and remarked that Miss Morris was, herself, the possessor of fine musical talents. He then launched into a dissertation on the divine art and I saw by the futile attempts of Prof. Morris to ring him off and turn the conversation into other channels that he was “wound up” on that subject. He dilated on Miss Morris’ great capacity for harmony and deplored her fatal deficiency in technique, in such a way as to show that
he had thoroughly analyzed her from the musical standpoint. I knew nothing of his musical terms but was an interested listener while he talked about his beautiful pupil and encouraged him to the top of his bent, although I could but smile as I noticed that he discussed her exactly as he would a piano or violin. I
wanted to “size him up” as we say in America and tried him on other subjects, but outside of his art, he was as blank as the backside of a tombstone. I asked him about the manner of his inspiration and he told me that he caught strains from the wind in the trees, from the singing of birds, from everything he heard that was not discordant. He informed me that he had a light Aeolian harp attached to his aero plane and as he sailed through the air he had only to arrange the music it made for him, to get his very best compositions. We went up into the “tower of music” and he described to us the perfections of his great instrument with as much pride and enthusiasm as an American would talk about his first baby. From a musical standpoint, he was decidedly interesting.

After walking over the beautiful grounds, we returned to the Marine building, where in the private office of my host, we remained until the hour for lunch.

“There is so much to tell you,” he replied to a question of mine in regard to the government, “that I hardly know how to begin. Take the elective franchise now; we have no voting for officers here as you do in the United States. Every man here, who is a citizen, has the same chance to hold office and that is unquestionably the only truly representative form of government.” “Do you call that a truly representative system,” I asked, “which gives the most stupid and untalented man an equal opportunity for office and political preferment that the brilliant, the forceful and the laborious enjoy?” “That is just
why I do call it truly representative,” answered the professor. “The great masses of mankind are stupid and untalented; without disparaging your country, which is also mine, I may safely say that ninety-nine out of every hundred men are untalented plodders. And yet, except in accidental cases, mediocre men
never have a seat in your national legislature unless they have inherited, or in some other way obtained money enough to buy it. The representation is almost wholly by the brilliant or forceful men; men who can by strength, genius or cunning, control circumstances and compel fortune. In the Iron Republic, every class of men, the brilliant, the forceful, the untalented and stupid, may hope to enjoy the honours of office in the proportion that they exist.”
 
“I am curious to know by what means you secure this average of representations,” said I, “for certainly in politics. I can conceive of no method which will not give the race to the swift and the battle to the strong.”
 
“Well, to begin with,” answered my friend, “we have no such thing here as politics, in the sense that the word is used in the United States. There, if there has been no improvement since I left the country, politics simply means that fierce, desperate and continuous struggle which goes on between brainy, unscrupulous and self-seeking men for place and power, where the strongest and most conscienceless stand to win and where success means selfish aggrandizement and gain. It is destructive to the finest sentiments of manhood and has debauched and prostituted the noblest intellects.,, “But you must admit,” I insisted, “that the strong and brainy men are best fitted to devise laws for the government, not only of themselves, but also of the stupid and un-talented, — if we may continue to so designate the ninety and nine plodders.”
 
“I admit nothing of the kind,” retorted the professor. “On the contrary, I believe that even in America, the least talented lawmakers are the most useful, because they have less reason to be influenced by considerations of personal ambition. It is with great intellect now, as it was with great skill and strength
in the olden time; it is almost invariably used to advance the interests of its possessor at the expense of the less gifted. I will agree that the more capable a man is, integrity and other sterling qualities being equal, the better fitted he is to devise laws for his fellows, provided his own selfish interests are in no way involved, and that is just the condition here. The laws for the government of this republic are devised by its scientists, scholars and philosophers, men who for the most part have no offices and no power to obtain them. Their efforts being thus absolutely untrammeled by considerations of selfish interest or ambition, are necessarily unselfish and for the good of their kind. Here, laws are originated by the people and adopted by them, the function of their representatives being simply to properly frame and execute statutes at their command. In other words, they are the servants and not the masters of the people.”
 
“But,” said I with a trace of impatience which I could not conceal, “you surely cannot expect that men who are capable of devising wise measures of public policy will do so without the hope of reward, either in the way of gain or gratified ambition !”
 
“Indeed I do expect it,” said my friend, “no man who ever had great thoughts could keep them to himself even though publishing them brought him persecution instead of profit. The finest intellects of the world have delved in the domains of science, philosophy and religion, without gain and why not in that noblest field for genius, the art of human government?”
 
“Well,” said I laughing, “we have a saying in America, that ‘you can’t argue against success,’ and in the presence of the monumental success of the ages I am without an argument. But I am curious to understand how it is done.”
 
“Nothing in the way of human government is so simple,” replied my friend, “unless it be an absolute despotism. We start with the assumption that any man or unmarried woman with the necessary qualifications of age, character and education, is entitled to be a citizen. Accordingly when he or she, goes to the proper authorities with a certificate from the register or supervisor of their primary, that they are twenty years old and that they are under conviction of no crime, with a diploma from the public school, they have issued to them a seal like this, (drawing from his purse the medal I had seen him use at the sub treasury in Corinthus), which invests them with all the rights and privileges of full citizenship in this republic, or to speak technically, they are ‘franklins’ of the first grade. Every office under the government is now as accessible to the dullest of these franklins as to the brightest. To make you understand more perfectly, it is necessary to explain to you the political divisions of the country. First, we have the ‘primary.' This consists, technically, of an area seven miles square, or forty-nine square miles and containing one thousand franklins. In practice, though, the extent of the primary is purely arbitrary, depending upon the quality of the soil, natural resources of the section and consequent density of population, and may contain one thousand franklins or any fraction thereof over three hundred. Of course, citizens can live in unorganised territory, that is, where no primary has been constituted; but this deprives them to some extent of their privileges if they are franklins of the first grade, as they have no opportunity to vote their seal and so pass into the second grade. If they are
franklins of the second grade though, they can vote their seal for the third grade in any primary in the commonwealth in which they live. Any citizen, too, can exercise the ‘ appellate ’ franchise and vote on the acceptance or rejection of laws in the primary most convenient to him. These primaries correspond to your precincts in America, and in the centre or part most accessible to all, is the shire, where is located the post office, sub treasury and public school. The only elective officer in the primary is the supervisor, (the lowest civil officer under the state,) who after one year’s service becomes by virtue thereof, primary magistrate. On the first of December the franklins meet at their shire and this officer is chosen by lot, every citizen having an equal chance. On the first of January, the lucky man on whom the choice has fallen, assumes the duties of the office, his predecessor becoming magistrate in place of the retiring incumbent. A primary magistrate exercises the functions of notary public and trial justice, has control of post office, public school and sub treasury and represents his primary in the commonwealth council, a body corresponding very nearly to your board of county commissioners. He employs postmasters, bookkeepers, schoolteachers and all who work for the state in his primary, at prices fixed by law. It is the principle of despotism, —the simplest and most economical form of government. —applied by the people themselves. ‘Vox despoto, vox populi,’ The supervisor is simply a subordinate officer or assistant to the magistrate with the power to act in his place when required."

After a citizen has served successfully as a supervisor and magistrate, he becomes a franklin of the second grade and is eligible to the next higher office under the state, which is that of commonwealth deputy in the provincial assembly. This body corresponds to your state legislature. One week after the primary election, the commonwealth election is held, which is participated in by all ex-magistrates in the commonwealth, and one is chosen commonwealth representative in the provincial assembly. The choice for all civil officers is by lot. A week later, the provincial elections are held and from the body of ex-commonwealth deputies one is chosen to represent the province in the national senate. All of the newly elected bodies meet on the first day of January and organise and the new senate from the whole number of ex-senators in the republic choose a new president. The primary elections occur annually, the commonwealth elections biennially and the provincial and presidential elections quadrennially, the terms of office being respectively, one, two and four years. A citizen is, by virtue of his seal, a citizen of the first grade; after he has served as magistrate, he is in the second grade. After serving as deputy in the provincial assembly, he is a franklin of the third grade and when he has been elected national senator he advances to the fourth grade. After he has served as president, he has no grade at all, having no longer the right to vote or participate in any election. No citizen is eligible to the same office more
than once and after serving in any of the capacities mentioned, be-comes eligible to the next office above and holds that grade if he does not go higher until he reaches the age limit, which is sixty years for the first grade and seventy for the others.

As with the exercise of the franchise in America, some of our citizens never contest for any office, having no desire for public life and it being entirely optional with them. When a man is out of office, he is only a private citizen having no advantage over any other franklin in the republic, except merely his eligibility, in common with all others of his grade, to the office next above the one he has held. Retiring presidents are an exception, as by virtue of having held every office under the state, they are considered preeminently qualified and become life members of the supreme cabinet, which body is composed of
ex-presidents and three citizens of the first grade, chosen for distinguished ability and appointed by the incoming president with the approval of the senate. This supreme cabinet serves as an advisory council to the president and as a national board of arbitration, to which is referred all vexed questions of internal administration. It is the highest authority in the republic and by its sanction; the president has the right to veto. Can you conceive of any scheme of government simpler than this?" asked my friend. “Our financial, judicial and penal systems are just as simple and satisfactory, but we have not time to go into them now." 

“'The scheme certainly possesses the merit of simplicity." I replied, “and yet under it, is it not possible, probable, — aye, extremely probable, that a controlling majority in these legislative bodies may be wholly incapable of framing suitable laws for a great state? My observation has been that men are egotistical and obstinate in the proportion that they are incompetent, and a majority of such men, it seems to me, would not only fail to legislate wisely, but would prevent a capable minority from doing so."

“My dear sir." exclaimed the professor, “you have not yet grasped the first principles of legislation in this great country. It is not the exclusive function of any of these legislative bodies to originate legislation. They may indeed, devise and propose laws, but they have no power to enact any whatever for the government of the people. Here is where the elective franchise comes in, as every law, whether proposed by the national senate for the republic, the provincial assembly for the province or the commonwealth council for the local government of the primaries, must be referred to the people and its acceptance or rejection determined by their vote. Wise measures of public policy are originated for the most part, by scholars and publicists and when they arc elaborated and perfected by public discussion. they are properly framed and submitted to the people in the appellate elections. It is the appeal to the people for an expression of their will on the subject; The people may take the initiative and compel legislative bodies to propose laws. This is a prerogative though, that is never exercised, for legislators knowing the alternative, are always willing to propose any legislation demanded by their constituents.

You want to bear in mind that there are no political parties here, such as you have in America, consequently there is not the vindictive strife and party feeling that you have there. There are no questions of personal ambition or party expediency to be considered and no motive to swerve any legislator from the most absolutely unselfish efforts for the public weal."

"There must certainly be differences of opinion on measures of public policy." I suggested.

“There are differences of opinion, of course, on nearly all measures that are proposed and they are discussed by the press and the people and then settled by vote of the sovereign citizens. But as there is no necessary connection between the success of these measures and that of any individual in the nation, the discussions are always moderate and intelligent. Unmarried women of legal age and widows with the necessary qualifications are franklins of the first grade and share with men the appellate franchise."

“Pray what compensation do these different legislative officers receive?" I asked:
 
“Primary supervisors and magistrates receive one and two dollars a day respectively, the year round because they are constantly employed,” answered the professor. "Provincial deputies receive three dollars a day for the time they are in session, national senators receive four dollars and presidents get five dollars for their full time as do members of the supreme cabinet, for they are constantly employed. There is no mileage, as the railroads are owned by the state and it costs them nothing to travel.”
 
"Five dollars a day for the president of a great nation!” The statement fairly took my breath.
 
"That is very munificent pay.” said my friend, “but as they give up all other business as well as their homes, and have to reside at the capitol, it is not considered too much, though their labor is intrinsically worth no more than that of the man who lays brick or shovels dirt."

“This is indeed a remarkable government!" I exclaimed.
 
"My fellow countryman.” said the professor rising. “I have the kindest memories of your country, for it is the land of my birth. But you have a very imperfect system of government. It is by no means representative and admits of more corruption than could exist under an intelligent despotism. It has been so with all previous attempts at popular government. It is an elastic system and heretofore with boundless territory and immense unused resources, it has been adequate. Congestion in the state as in the human body is fatal and you will ultimately reach a period of congestion. The great billows in mid-ocean roll grandly on without danger and without noise, save a deep soothing murmur. It is only when they reach their outmost bounds and dash themselves on the rock hound coast to be thrown back in broken, foaming masses, that the angry roar of the breakers is heard, sending terror to the heart of the mariner. As long as you have, unoccupied territory for your increasing tides of population to flow out upon, your people will have homes and as long as the majority of them have homes and property, you are safe, for it is the illusion of all partially civilised people that the object and end of government is to protect property. But under your system, the time will come when comparatively few people will own most of the property and control the means of subsistence: then, they will logically combine for mutual protection and aggression and learning the terrible power of combination, will inevitably throttle the spirit of liberty and crush the life blood out of your people. On the other hand, a few men in whom the love for wealth and power has extinguished the love of liberty and their fellow men, owning all the wealth and by the power of that wealth controlling production, transportation, legislation, everything! On the other hand, millions of people only a few generations re-moved from the noblest and most heroic ancestors reduced to the conditions of serfs! Aye, to even a worse condition, for the medieval serf might work and fight for his master, but with your hundred handed machinery to produce and the blind greed which will deprive the masses of the power to consume, their services will be dispensed with. Their labor will not he required and there is nothing their masters will want them to fight for as they will possess everything. There is the picture for you, sir; heartless greed, oppression, ill-gotten wealth fortified by legislation and protected by hired minions on one side, and on the other, millions who cry for the opportunity to earn bread! And if you want it shaded, there is dynamite and gunpowder and gorgeous combustible villas, all great smoke makers!’

My companion had been pacing the floor excitedly as he poured out these burning words, but now stopping before me his mood suddenly changed and he smiled broadly. “Why bless me. I am talking to you as though your destiny was bound up in the United States and you were going back there next week, when as a matter of fact we are, both of us, absolutely cut off and that country is no more to us than the lost Atlantis or the cities of the plain! Come. I don’t know how you feel, but this great outflow of words seems to have left a void that reminds me that it is about the hour for lunch.” Stepping to the ubiquitous transmitter he gave some orders about a carriage and I heard him say something about a two seater at the hour of fourteen. Passing out of the building we walked through the handsome grounds of Capitol square and had barely reached the Boulevard that surrounded it when a light carriage came whizzing down upon us, in which we took our seats and were propelled swiftly to my friend’s house in the suburbs.

“I have been greatly interested in what you have told me about your government.” I said as we rode along, “but one thing you did not explain I would like to know, and that is how the lots are cast which elects one man to office out of the great number of candidates."

“Now." said my friend." by a fortunate circumstance, you can have an opportunity of seeing just how it is done, as a magistrate has recently resigned in one of the commonwealths of this province to accept a position in the sub-treasury at Aegia in the province of Vandalia and if you remember, there was an item in the news current this morning which stated that an election would be held tomorrow to fill the vacancy occasioned by the supervisor taking his place. It is only about an hour's run on the Ironia and Olympian railway and you can go down and see it for yourself which will be better than any description you could have of it.”
 
It was accordingly arranged that I should run down the next morning and take it in.

When we arrived at the house of my friend, I found a gentleman waiting for me with a tape line and a book of cloth samples who was introduced as a very capable furnisher. I learned that my host had asked him to call and take my measure for an outfit. I went up to my room with the outfitter and was surprised at the excellent quality of his samples, there being no shoddy or inferior goods in the lot. I intimated to him that as I had a very complete wardrobe and as the period of my sojourn in that, country was uncertain. I did not desire anything expensive, preferring something rather, of good appearance without regard to durability. The smiling’ tailor told me though, that he had no goods that would not wear for years, all being equally well made and the only difference being in the weight of the material, Inspecting a piece of black casimer. I asked him if he could guarantee the dye to retain the lustre, and to my astonishment was informed that he did not handle any dyed cloths at all, everything he had being in the natural colour of the wool, which included every shade of handsome suitings of the finest and firmest texture. Remarking the excellence of the quality. I volunteered the compliment that his factories evidently turned out better goods than ours, whereupon he informed me that every piece was woven by hand and that there was not a cloth factory in the republic! In the meantime, I had made my selection and he was engaged in taking my measure.

"Do you mean to tell me,” I asked with astonishment, “that a nation so far advanced as yours does not use machinery in the manufacture of cloth?” “None at all.” was the reply. “They used to, long before my time, but under the republic no factories are allowed.”

“And do you weave this cloth, or do you have to go around and find it among the private individuals who weave it?” I asked.
 
“Oh, I simply go to the Government Exchange, which takes it from the weavers, and get what I want.” 

“Does the government speculate in this cloth or simply store it and sell it for the weavers?”
 
“The government does not speculate on anything,” replied the outfitter. “It takes this cloth, giving the weaver in exchange, the price established by the bureau of Subsistence, which is based on the weight and weave of the goods. It is then sold to whoever wants it at a slight advance which is the seignior age,
or principal source of revenue for the support of the state.”
 
“Then there is no competition.” I remarked. “I suppose the prices for the different grades are purely arbitrary with this bureau.”
 
“No, the price of nothing is arbitrary,” returned the tailor. “The value of everything being fixed by the average cost of production, as ascertained by the bureau in the most careful and scientific manner.” 

“There must be,” said I, “some unsaleable goods made, as there is in my country: does the exchange have to take them at the production price, regardless of what they will sell for.” “'The exchange sometimes has goods that will not sell for the established price by reason of their undesirability, damage
in storage, or other causes. When that is the case, they are cut to the selling point. It frequently happens too, especially with agricultural productions, that the price of one article is reduced, while that of other things, which compete with it or displace it, is raised. The bureau has all of that in hand and the business is reduced to a science. The exchange also has the right to reject anything and so producers keep in touch with it and thus know what the public demand is for."

Here was another field opened up to my curiosity which I would have liked very much to explore by further questioning, but my outfitter did his work expeditiously and lunch was waiting. At the table I introduced the subject and asked why the manufacture of cloth by machinery was prohibited in the Iron Republic. “We prohibit the use of machinery in the making of cloth," answered my host, "for the same reason that we do in the manufacture of every-thing else that the people can supply without the aid of
machinery: that is, that there may be work for all."

“Do I understand that you have no manufactures at all?" I asked.
 
"Not that we have none at all, but none for the manufacture of any article that can be applied on sufficient quantity to meet the demand, without the use of machinery. This list includes fabrics of almost every description, shoes, hats, head wear, furniture, rope, agricultural implements and products,
vehicles, in fact almost everything that we use."

"And the purpose of this is that there may be work for all to do?"

“That is the purpose." replied my host, "and the purpose is accomplished, for as it requires the work of all to supply the wants of all, there is no enforced idleness in this republic."

But said I, with a disposition to argue every point, one man with a machine can do the work of a hundred and it seems to me that with your admirable political conditions, you might well employ the use of machinery, thereby giving the people more time for recreation and the improvement of the mind.” ‘‘Certainly there is great temptation to use a machine that will do the work of a hundred men.” replied my host, “and if the hundred men were the beneficiaries of its efficiency, there could be no excuse for not using it. You employ labor saving machinery in the United States, and where it does the work of a hundred or a thousand men do they get the benefit of it?” I could not say that they did.
 
“As a matter of fact,” continued my host, “does anybody derive any benefit except the owners of the ma-chine?" I was obliged to confess that they were the only direct beneficiaries, but that the cost of production was lessened, which of course, must be to the advantage of all.

“Ah. my friend!” exclaimed the professor, “I very much fear that your argument is influenced by your legal training, for it is palpably one sided, being predicated on the assumption that a machine doing the work of a hundred men, lessens the price of its products without diminishing the purchasing power of the hundred men who have been deprived of work by it. Now’ let us come down to practical illustration. You use machinery in the manufacture of shoes; to what extent does it lessen labor and cost?" “Very much indeed," I answered warming up to the advantage 1 thought I saw. “With improved machinery and a division of labor. I have been informed that a man can make a pair of shoes every seven minutes, at a cost of thirty cents." “Very well; if you are not positive though as to the accuracy of your data, we will allow some latitude and say they make a pair in twelve minutes, at a cost of fifty cents. That will be
fifty pairs in a day of ten hours. Your man with the machine then has done the work of fifty men. What pay does he receive?” “From the best of my information an average of about two dollars per pay." I replied." Your man is paid two dollars a day and turns out a product that sells for $25 in” “Oh no!” I interrupted, “that costs $25 to make." “I see," said my host smiling: “this is the cost of making. Now what do these shoes sell for?"

"I should say an average of $1.50.”
 
“Ah! Then this man does the work of fifty men and turns out a product, that is worth $100 more than the cost of production. Who gets this $100.” asked my host laying down his fork and looking across the table at me with an air of affected simplicity.

“The man or company that owns the machine, I suppose,” I answered slightly nettled.
 
“Then the forty-nine men whose work has been done for them do not come in except in the matter of increased time for recreation! But what surprises me most,” my host went on, “is that these shoes can be made for fifty cents and sold for $150. How is this feat, so contrary to the laws of competition
accomplished?”
 
“In the first place,” I answered, “our manufacturers combine to maintain prices among themselves and in the second place we
have a tariff which brings the imported article up to that price.”
 
“So!” exclaimed my host, “I begin to comprehend your system which I presume was the same when I left the country, but as I was quite a young man and had never paid much attention to such matters. I retain no knowledge on the subject. Now let us look into this system in its practical application. Here is a
machine that in one day with the application of one man’s labor does the work of fifty men, thereby depriving forty-nine men of the opportunity to work. In the value of the product it turns out, it earns the wages of fifty men and yet all that labor gets out of it is the paltry sum of $2 or not enough to pay for
the result of fifteen minutes of its time, the balance going to the owner of the machine. So while flesh and blood and brains and skill earns $2 for labor, wood and iron and steel earns $50 for capital! And this wonderful machine too, in all probability, is the product of skill and labor at the same miserable wage! Is this system conducive to an equitable distribution of wealth among the people? Does it not rather impoverish the forty-nine men whose work is done by the machine and enrich one man who gets the value of fifty men’s work for the price of one?”
 
I could not deny so logical a conclusion.

“Now in the Iron Republic,” continued the professor, “where machinery is not allowed to supplant labor, to produce fifty pairs of shoes in one day would probably require the work of fifty men and the value of their product would be divided among them. So the question resolves itself into this proposition; which is better, to let fifty men earn one dollar apiece, or to let two men earn $100, (one of whom works while the other keeps books), of which amount the working man gets $2 while the bookkeeper gets the balance?”
 
The proposition did not admit of debate, but I could not refrain from remarking that it seemed a pity that fifty men should labor a day to accomplish what an inanimate machine might do without toil or fatigue.

"Not necessarily,” retorted my host. “In appearance and according to the ethics of industrial economy, there could be no objection to the machine doing the work of fifty men if the fifty men got the benefit of its work. And yet it is contrary to the Divine economy, as expressed in the Biblical injunction that man shall eat bread by the sweat of his brow, and like every other human practice that runs contrary to the Divine order, is harmful in its results and I think your system must demonstrate it. Notwithstanding the use of machinery, you doubtless have a large number of men who are steadily and permanently employed; now which makes the best showing, mentally and morally, this steadily employed class, or the unemployed or partially employed class whose time for recreation and the improvement of the mind has been increased by the use of machinery?” I was compelled to confess that the employed class took precedence both in point of intelligence and morals, I remarked too, that it was a disappointing fact that our public libraries, night schools and other institutions founded for the benefit and elevation of the masses, were least patronised by those of most leisure. “It is not strange,” said my host. “The reasonable employment of the body, prepares the mind for recreation. A man’s mind though, especially if it be not well cultivated, having nothing to employ it but recreation, grows bad just as most boys do who have nothing to do but play. The universe is founded on a plan and that plan contemplates that every man shall work. The man, who does not, suffers and society suffers by him. There are no exceptions to this rule.”
 
“I confess that you have had the better of me all along.” said I, “but you are certainly mistaken when you say that there are no exceptions to this rule, for many of our most intelligent and virtuous men are those who have grown vastly rich from the results of other men’s labor. I may say most generous also, for in my country hundreds of churches, colleges, libraries and other beneficent institutions stand as monuments to this virtue in them today.” “Undoubtedly." assented the professor, “and yet I must remind you in the first place that a man who becomes a millionaire from the increment of other men’s labor, can be no idler, for the mere keeping up with his business and getting the lion’s, tiger's and wolf’s share of the product of the labor employed by him, will keep him busy. And in the second place when a man makes gifts with money obtained that way, is such generosity in any manner different from that of Robin Hood, who robbed one class and gave to another? Is it even as commendable, for the old highwayman invariably took from the rich and gave to the poor, at the worst doing evil that good might come, by contributing to the equalisation of wealth, while your millionaires take from the poor and give in such a way as to enhance their reputation, this being the only thing to be desired after having acquired more money than they can use in promoting their pleasures. From my point of view, there is no more generosity in such actions than there was in Trajan’s lavish expenditure on his tomb. I think you will find too, that the sons of these millionaires who inherit the money without the training that came with its accumulation, will suffer and make society suffer, thus proving the old Bible doctrine that the sins of the parents are visited on the children unto the third and fourth generation.”
 
“That doctrine may be true in theory,” I replied laughing “but in my country the first generation usually exhausts the possibility of the evil by getting rid of the root of it.”
 
“In as far as the money itself may contribute directly to the evil,” assented my host;” but a life of profligacy and dissipation made possible by inherited wealth may leave a train of evils behind it extending to generations unborn."

“Then you regard wealth as an evil, do you?” I asked.
 
“I certainly regard wealth as a most prolific source of evil and where it is acquired in the manner we have been discussing, that is, where a poor man is required to make shoes for a rich man for fifty cents and then pay $1.50 for the same shoes for himself and family to wear, it is an evil per se. You say this is partly the result of legislation and if it is, yours is a government of the minority, for there must be fewer rich, than poor men.” “I grant what you say,” I replied. “Government is of, for and by the rich, always has been and probably always will be, because wealth is power. But it does not necessarily follow that for that reason it is bad. In the co-operation of mind and matter in the affairs of human government as in everything else, mind must predominate. In predominating, it secures the conditions of life most favorable to itself and thus extends its sphere, as in an exploring party a few men by getting more than their share of food arc enabled to penetrate faster and further than their comrades. But as they blaze the way they open up, it is easier for the rest to follow; and so I believe the world has been the gainer by the very inequalities and injustice, which you condemn. In its age long and worldwide advance, the human mind has not marched in a phalanx. Under favoring conditions the strongest and boldest have broken away and led the advance, scaling walls to others impregnable and climbing heights inaccessible to the average and placing beacon lights to make the ascent easier for those that follow.”
 
"My dear sir,” exclaimed the professor, "your figure is very pretty, but I think it is so only because of the beautiful words in which you have clothed it. Skill in the art of dressing may be made to hide many defects,” (with a sly glance at the ladies.) but I am not going to be taken in by mere external appearances. It is not your figure I find fault with but your logic. Let us state your proposition in the form of a syllogism and proceed logically. Major premise: — In its advancement, mind will secure to itself the conditions most favorable to its expansion; minor premise. — but wealth is most favorable to the expansion of the mind; conclusion, it is therefore by the aid of wealth that the human mind has advanced to its present wonderful stage of development. Is this a fair and logical statement of the proposition?” I admitted that it was.
 
Very well; then I dispute your minor premise and deny your conclusion,” said my host p ositively. “Wealth is not favorable to the expansion of the mind and for its wonderful development it acknowledges no financial obligation whatsoever. Under the patronage of wealth which was to be the gainer by its product, mind has wrought some of its most beautiful creations and in modem times




 
wealth has supplied in some instances tools to facilitate its work; but in the main, money has rather been the enemy of mind, and wealth, whether supporting monarchical extravagance, religious bigotry or personal vanity and ambition, has tended to suppress rather than promote the highest and noblest qualities of the human mind. Its sublimest efforts have been achieved in poverty, in exile, in dungeons even, and as for scaling walls impregnable and climbing heights inaccessible, and planting beacon lights for others, as per your pretty figure, the most gifted men have gone to the stake or scaffold, because power, which has always been synonymous with wealth did not approve.”
 
I began to get warm in the collar, for though I had engaged in the discussion more for information than argument, the ease and skill with which my opponent had met and defeated me at every point, aroused all of the belligerency of my nature. But what made it more exasperating too, the ladies seemed to be deeply interested listeners and caught every point.

“Since you have appealed to Caesar,” said I, “unto Caesar will we go. If you resort to logic, I will meet you with your own weapon and state another syllogism for you to disprove. Major premise; in all times wealth and power have been used to repress and retard the development of the mind; minor premise, but it is in the nature of mind to resist oppression and its mightiest energies have been aroused in this resistance; conclusion; therefore wealth and power have unwittingly contributed to the development and expansion of the mind!”
 
“Very neatly turned!” cried the professor, while the ladies smiled and Miss Helen even infringed the neutrality law's by clapping her hands. “Then your position,” continued my host, “is that everything which opposes the advancement of the mind really facilitates its development?”
 
“Not precisely. Everything which arouses the resistance and overcoming instinct of the mind,” I returned.

“The point is well taken and strongly stated,” conceded the professor. “but, what wealth and power has contributed to the development of the mind by such direct oppression as to arouse resistance and wake its slumbering energies, is slight in comparison with the blight and stag¬ nation induced by war, financial oppression and industrial wrongs.”
 
"You charge these things to wealth then?"

"I do, most unqualifiedly,” responded my host. "Homer would have us believe that the Trojan War was fought for love, but the wars of history have been for wealth and power.”
 
"I make the point on you,” I returned, “that the poorest nations have been the least intelligent and that industrial wrongs have always been greatest where ignorance has been grossest. I think that history will sustain me in the further assertion, that war has been the great civiliser of the world.”
 
“Incontrovertible statements, all,” asserted my opponent,” and incorrect only as they confuse cause and effect; if the poorest nations have been the least intelligent, they were the poorest because they were the least intelligent and not unintelligent because they were poor. If industrial wrongs have been greatest where ignorance has been most dense, it is simply because the people being ignorant were least able to defend themselves against industrial wrongs. If civilisation has been a product of war, it is a bi-product and resulted because notwithstanding the barbarity and inhumanity of the wars, they brought different peoples together and the knowledge of different nations, by amalgamation, was enlarged. War itself is debasing to the human mind.”
 
“I take issue with you on that," said I hotly. “War may be destructive but it is not debasing. War may be cruel, but cruelty calls forth nobility. War may make widows and orphans, but it also makes heroes, and liberty and patriotism have been fructified by all the blood the earth has ever drunk!"

"And what has been the liberty of the world,” my friend asked scornfully, "but the illusion which people cherish when they have exchanged one set of masters for another? And what is the patriotism of the world but that savage and senseless prejudice which is cultivated by teaching the fools of nation to hate
the fools of other nations? And when the fools of two nations have been set by the ears by their rulers, they tight and maim and kill — and this is called glorious war!”
 
"I beg a truce!" I cried, seeing that my venerable host felt deeply on the subject, while I was merely endeavoring to hold up my end of the argument." I find that I am no match for you Iron Republicans. I have only en-countered these accomplished ladies, yourself and Professor Hallam, and on the subjects of dress, industrial economy and music I find that I know nothing; am eliminated, obliterated. In other words, to use an Americanism. I am not in it, and hereby surrender, foot horse and dragoons. I cannot offer you my sword for I presume there is no such thing in this model republic."

"They were all beaten into plow-shares long since," answered my friend smiling good humouredly, “so that formality will have to be dispensed with. I am generous though in victory and will pay you the compliment to say that if your cause was worthy of your prowess, the result might be different. In all contests though, the justice of a cause is not less an element of strength than the greatness of cannon and sharpness of steel." I bowed my acknowledgement of the compliment and indulged the hope that I might yet find some vulnerable point in the Iron Republic, if for nothing else than to redeem myself in the fair eyes that had witnessed my discomfiture.

"I think you are entirely too magnanimous in professing defeat,” said Miss Morris, taking part in the conversation for the first time and looking at me with her beautiful eyes beaming with interest. “If you are not too proud to accept an humble ally,” (I bowed again.) “I venture to suggest that the enemy,"(smiling and flashing a glance at her father,) “may attribute his victory — if indeed he has won it — to the fact that the fighting was all in his own territory where he was entrenched. It is my opinion, if I am worthy to be admitted to a council of war that you run up the white flag too soon." “With the glorious prospect such a promising alliance opens up to me,” I replied facetiously but with a peculiar thrill of gratification. “I hasten to pull down the flag of defeat and beg that you will advance into the breach.’’ “Well.” said my fair ally, “I reopen the attack by the assertion that it was not alone in bringing the nations into closer intercourse that war has exerted a civilising and elevating influence on the human mind. I believe that the highest and noblest thoughts of the peaceful present, owe their origin to the high and noble deeds of a past made glorious by war.”
 
“Tut. tut.” exclaimed her father, "the romances of history and Sir Walter Scott have corrupted your mind.”
 
“Kindled rather.” retorted my ally with a vigour that proved she was in earnest. ”I acknowledge my indebtedness to history and Sir Walter and when I read of the deeds of Couer de Lion and Ivanhoe, even of Dalgetty and Debracy, I cannot abide the goody goodliness of a big nation like this that works and


eats and slumbers like an ox. What would be the history of the world today if the Iron Republic had been
founded on the Babylonian empire and its principles had received worldwide acceptances? Try to think
of a history of the world without an Alexander or Caesar or Frederick the Great, or Bonaparte or
Washington. Without a Marathon or Thermopylae, without Crusades or Couer de Lion!”
 
I was surprised at the energy with which these words were uttered and suspected that the strong
feeling that prompted them must have been long repressed. My host looked astonished and Mrs. Morris
turned to her daughter with a glance of concern as though she had suddenly discovered in her traces of
insanity.
“The history of the world, my dear,” said her father after a moments silence, "we may not alter or
amend and perhaps would not if we could. It is with the world’s life as with a man’s: the excesses,
dissipations and sins of early years cannot be blotted out and the experience of them may even serve to
enhance the virtues of maturer age. Sometimes such experiences become the foundation of a nobler
and more purposeful life and then they may he recalled without regret. But it is a poor life that does not
improve with age and the world's life will be unrounded and incomplete if it is not profited by the
knowledge and experience of the past.” It is not in me to controvert these words so seriously and truly
spoken, but with my new ally, I was in the predicament of the man in the Indian fable, who made an
alliance with the tiger and found, after he had bound himself with thongs to that unconquerable beast,
that he could not run away when he would.
"I trust you will not be angry with me father, i
f I seem to dispute with you,” replied Miss Helen with un
-
yielding firmness, “but can that have been wholly bad in the past, which is the source of all that is most
beautiful in the present? What is the inspiration of poetry and all great thoughts but the high deeds
which you impute to the recklessness of the world’s youth? War is cruel, but does not its very cruelty
provoke nobler sacrifices
—
as Mr. Barrington has said
—
and a more exalted heroism than the piping
herdsmen of Utopia ever dreamed of? And may it not be in the plan of creation that sunshine and
storm, tears and laughter, love and hate, war and peace, shall alternate like day and night to the end of
time?”
 
“My daughter,” answered her father gravely. “I am grieved at the low estimation in which you
 seem to
hold your country, and that condition which has been the desire of the ages, but you are entitled to your
opinions and I would not have you repress them in deference to me. It is my faith though, that the plan
of creation contemplates the ultimate elimination of hate and strife and all evil whatsoever. And though
he may not appeal to youth and a romantic imagination. the piping herdsmen of Utopia, who tends his
flocks and lives in peace, with clean hands and an up-right heart, is to me, a nobler example of God's
creation than any medieval swashbuckler that ever drew sword or broke lance to win the silly fancy of a
foolish lady love. To my mind Professor Hallam, who would walk around a block rather than tread upon
a worm, is a greater man than Couer de Lion ever was, from every intelligent point of view."
“It may be wrong and wicked.” cried the beautiful woman vehemently, with flashing eyes and flushed
face, “and if it is I can’t help it and I don’t care; but I am tired to death of this dreary monoton
y of peace and prosperity, and the ring of a spearhead upon a breastplate or the clash of swords in a glorious cause would make sweeter music for me than all the piping herdsmen of Utopia. — or all the fiddlers of Ironia, for that matter.” and bursting into tears she rose hastily from the table and left the room. “Well I’ll declare!” exclaimed my host pushing back his chair. “Who can solve the female enigma?”
