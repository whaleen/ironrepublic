# THE IRON REPUBLIC

## Chapter 1

(PDF page 4) DEAR SIR: -- Since the visit of your representative to my vessel I have thought over the matter and decided to respond to your invitation to give and account of my strange adventures for the benefit of your readers. I write the narrative for your magazine because you have been kind enough to ask for it and because your interest and consideration is in marked contrast to that of other editors who have treated me with positive discourtesy, refusing to accept the statement of my experiences seriously. I am well aware that much of what I shall relate will appear incredible, and doubtless the whole story will be set down by many as a purely fanciful creation, like the fictions produced by Bellamy* and other theorists within the past few years.

*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Schindler_Bellamy]

About this matter, though I give myself no concern, as the many incontrovertible proofs, documentary and otherwise, which I have on board, will, when presented to the proper authorities, receive the recognition of the government in due and proper form, as also that of geographical and scientific societies the world over.

I regret that my narrative, provided and demonstrative as it will be, must unsettle scientific theories and make it necessary to reconstruct some of our school books. But while this will result in temporary inconvenience and shake the faith of some of the dicta of science, upon the whole the benefit will far exceed the injury. It is well to have out scientific theories unsettled every now and then, or we would become fossilised and arrogant like the bigots of the middle ages and appose and further advance in knowledge.

It is unnecessary to say that after my narrative has been accepted, the Zetetic theory of earth as a plane will have to be recognised and the geographies made in conformity therewith.

IN writing, this history of my adventures i wish it distinct;y understood that I make no pretensions to literary style or ability and my account will probably be crude and faulty in many respects. My only effort will be to tell a round unvarnished tale true in every particularly, for I realise that it is only in is truthfulness that the story can be of any value.

A Man whose literary efforts have been limited to lawyer's briefs, few and far between, and whose supremest and most extended written effort was a spread eagle thesis in the science of politics, at the conclusion of an uneventful college career, cannot be expected to be a model of literary excellence. But to come to my story. In the autumn of '94 I was enjoying a comfortable practice in a flourishing county town in one the the great states of the middle west. I Say comfortable practice. because it was one that entailed very little work and gave me plenty of time to devote to society and politics, for the latter of which I had always felt a strong predilection. MY father had achieved some distinction as an officer in the civil war and afterwards rose high in the politics of his state. It was the opinion of many that had he entered the arena of politics at an earlier period in his life, he might have risen to the very highest office in the nation.

It has always been my desire to emulate his political career, and the prestige of his name with my strong inclination for public life, gave reasonable promise of success. Modesty forbids the mention of other reasons, though I already enjoyed some reputations as a speaker and was regarded by politicians throughout the state as a fighter and a "coming man."

I Had adopted the profession of law as nearest allied to the politics and a brass plate bearing the name of "J. Edward Barrington, Attorney and Counsellor at Law," adorned my door, though I was known in political circles as Ned Barrington and a "live wire." There was not great demand for my professional services and I was not displeased that my social and political popularity far outshone my professional fame. The reader will understand my position when I say, by way of explanation, that I was not dependent upon my profession for support, my father who died during my last year in college, having left ample fortune for a young man of my steady habits and inexpensive tastes. AND so, at the time my story opens I may say without offensive egoism, that I was rather a promising young man of, twenty-four, with a clear conscience, infinite digestion and (I say it modestly) a fair share of good looks.

I was a member of the Young Men's Christian Association, president of a flourishing literary club and had been for a year past the chairman of the republican executive committee of our country. I Was also a leading spirit in a local temperance society and supposed to considerable influence with the better elements of society in the town and country. I had never been a candidate for any office, but was a worker in my party, content to wait for my time. *I am thus particular in these uninteresting details, because on them hinged the events that changed the whole course of my life, and give me and experience that will, in all probability, make my name as familiar in future generations as that of Galileo or Columbus.* The campaign of '94 was a particularly heated one. "Fatty" Burkheit, a notorious dive-keeper, had been nominated by the republican party as the candidate for congress from our district and a wave of indignation swept over the country. Meetings were held, several of which I addressed, and this action of the party was condemned on all sides. This district was republican by a large majority, but many life-long republicans declared that they would never vote for such a candidate.



(PDF page 6) The Democratic convention had nominated “Buck” Magee, and X prize fighter, other reputation so unsavoury, that the alternative of voting for the opposition candid it was not to be thought of period

One evening in September, I was sitting before a comfortable fire in my library reading the evening paper, when my office boy announced a party of gentlemen. Supposing it was some members of the executive committee come to talk over the political situation, or a party of friends to enjoy a rubber of whist, I had them ushered in. T abbreviate this part of my story as much as possible, it transpired that this gentleman were members of the democratic committee and came with the proposition to cast the bulk of their party vote for me if I would commit myself to be brought forward as an independent candidate. They pointed out that the respectable element of the republican party demanded a candidate that it could vote for, and that with this vote and the support I would get from the democratic party, my election was assured. It is not necessary to dwell upon the details of that conference. Suffice it to say that the interest was so great and their reasoning so cogent that I consented in the interest of morality and good government, to lead the movement. It seemed to be the providential opening to a great career, and when, in the enthusiasm occasioned by my acquiescence, the four gentlemen (who seemed to be men of great wealth,) shook hands with me and with each other and pledged a thousand dollars apiece in support of the campaign against corruption, I could do no less than hand them a check for a like amount.

This part of my narrative may be tiresome reading but it is part of the story and in telling a story as in solving a problem, there is nothing like having all the factors stated at the beginning.

I will pass over the exciting events of that campaign: the speeches I made, the letters received, commending, warning, threatening even: the abuse heaped upon me by members of my own party, is all part of political history of the district. Up to the last week of the campaign it seemed that my election was certain. 

A few days before the election I was waited upon by a committee of “workers,” with a letter of introduction from the chairman of the democratic committee, which stated that the support of these gentlemen was absolutely essential to my success at the polls. After reading the letter I turned to the party, which had remained standing and asked what I could do for them. Taking a stub of a cigar from his mouth and squirting a lot of tobacco juice on my carpet, the leader, a big nosed dutchman, made two or three awkward attempts to speak and finally blurted out something like the following: 

“**dots all right cabding, you don vanst ter ged lefd at der pallot box. Goot! Id dakes monish der make der mare drot. See? Ve vill gif you der subbort of der zaloon geepers for ten thousant tollars vich buts you in congress vare you can makes id back on one vode. See? You puts oop der ten thousant er shwing der vode ant goes to congress: You done put oop und sthays ter hoo. Und now vich is it**?” 

*ed: Write in plain english and explain the accent rather than making people read that mush?*.

And replacing the the cigar stub in his mouth and putting his arms akimbo, he looked for the world like a fiery fat jug with a handle on both sides. To say that I was astonished, does not express it. I was utterly dumbfounded. The appearance of the men in my house had been an insult and when the vile proposition was made it was more than I could endure and without standing on the quality of my English I turned them summarily out of doors.

The balance is soon told. The democrats voted solidly for their candidate as it was intended they should, and as I drew about fifty percent of the republican vote, a democrat was elected to conger of rate first time in history of our district.

I learned afterwards that if I had paid the ten thousand dollars  it would in no wise have affected the result. The money I did advance was not used in furthering my candidacy at all and the whole scheme was a device to divide and defeat the republican party in the district.

The morning after the election I was the most universally hated man in the state. I was abused, ridiculed, cartooned.  Life-long friends turned their backs upon me as a man who had sacrificed principle and sold himself in the vin hope of gratifying an inordinate political ambition.  Some of those even, who had supported my candidacy, shook their heads dubiously and said there had been selling somewhere!

This, with the natural mortification I felt at having been used as a cat’s paw and defeated, thus cutting off prematurely my anticipated political career, made existence  burden and I determined to leave forever the scene of my disgrace.

But where could I go? My name was familiar from one end of the
country to the other, even my features. from a half-page cartoon in a New York paper representing me as a cat's paw pulling out of the ﬁre a most self satisﬁed looking chestnut, which revealed the countenance of the successful democratic candidate. After some bitter reflection, I decided to convert my property into money, and purchase a vessel large enough and strong enough to bear me beyond the confines of civilisation, for only there did I feel that I could escape from the scorn of my fellowmen.

My eventful voyage, my discovery of the “Iron Republic" with its
remarkable government and industrial conditions, my residence on this hitherto unknown continent, and study of its wonderful advancement in civilisation and the arts of life. I will give an account of, to the best at my ability in this narrative, which I trust may be as interesting as it is true. In the meantime the people of Jacksonville are welcome on board of my vessel at all times, where they will be at liberty to inspect the many articles of interest which I brought from the land which lies beyond the ice barriers of the Antarctic circle.

## CHAPTER 2

As soon as possible after the disastrous termination of my first and last political campaign. I turned everything I had into gold and going down to New York bought the line vessel which now lies in this harbour, somewhat the worse for wear, but still staunch and seaworthy. I shipped a good crew and a captain who had spent twenty years of his life playing hide and seek with icebergs
as master of a whaler. My intention was to go on a three. years' cruise into the Arctic regions and probably remain there, devoting the remainder of my life to the good of those isolated people, running the ship back and forth to the port of some civilised country.

After a conversation with Cap-
tain Brent. however. I changed my
plans and decided to go south in-
stead of north. My reason for this
was that Captain Brent had done all
of his whaling in southern waters and
was familiar with every piece of terra
ﬁrma from the straits of Magellan to
Kirgnelan's Land and knew nothing
whatever about the Arctic regions.
And inasmuch as my object was to

get away and as far away as possible
from the haunts of civilized men. I
readily agreed and drew the papers
for a three years’ cruise to extend as
far south as I should desire, “open
water permitting."

years' cruise, ﬁfty thousand dollars

vate cabin and a picked crew. l sail-
ed out of New York harbor literally
shaking the dust of my native coun-
try from my feet. and carrying a
lighter heart than I had for months
past.

It is not necessary to draw out
and magnify the incidents of this
voyage. There are writers, (W. Clark
Russel for instance.) whose business
in life is to describe sea voyages. The
chief interest in this story must lie
in what was accomplished by the
voyage and not the voyage itself. In

able considering the season of the
year and we drew down rapidly to-
wards the tropics.

()n the 10th of August we cross-
ed the equator and I brought out
half dozen bottles of wine and a box
of cigars and had the sailors. who
were all smart American boys. aft.
About the last of September we
passed the cape and began to realize
that we were indeed leaving the hab-
itable world and passing into a soli-
tude of waters whose southern boundaries were unknown. And here our real voyage began.

There is a ﬁerceness and black-
nus in these wild waters below the
cape that those familiar only with
the ship courses of the Atlantic and
Paciﬁc. can form no conception of.
Wilder and wilder grew the sea as
we drew southward, but Captain
Brent was an old navigator and I
feared the terrors of the whole An-
arctic region not so much as a single
cartoon in an American newspaper.

In a hundred and ﬁfty-one days
after leaving New York we encount-
ered ice and a month later we were
sailing along the southern ice bar-
riers that towered like sapphire cliffs
as far as the eye could see in either
direction. It was now summer time
in these regions and Captain Brent
said he had never seen the sea so
clear of ice. Whales spouted in every
direction and sea fowl by thousands
sailed above us or perched among
the icy precipices. The grandeur of
the scenery about us at this time baf-
fles description. As we sailed leisure-
ly east by south. there was a wall of
ice on our right. ranging from fifty to
three hundred feet high. giving out
with a splendor which no artist may
portray. the gorgeous hues of the
rainbow. In some places the eliﬁs
overhung making great grottoes in
which the largest ship might ﬂoat.

On the 23rd of December we
sighted the lofty summit of Mount

Erebus. the only volcano. so far as
is known in the Anarctic regions. 0n
the 29th., turning a spur or promon-
tory of ice that jutted out many miles
into the sea, we ran into a great cove
land-locked. or rather ice-locked.
where the water was smooth and where the cliffs shelved up gradually
from the water's edge, reaching back
and up many thousand feet, to where
the opal tinted ice shaded off into
the dull gray and brown oi the rug.
ged and barren rocks of Mount Ere-
bus.

Standing on the deck of the ship
and looking up the wide and irreg-
ular incline of ice that extended
from the water's edge tip to where
the rugged sides oi Mount Erehus
showed above, I enjoyed one of the
grandest sights ever looked upon by
man. This sloping incline was broken
into hundreds of terraces down
which the melting snow water dash-
ed in innumerable cascades and
poured into the sea. making great
banks of lleeey foam that froze and
tloated away. as it were. gossamer
icebergs.

As I gazed up this terraced in-
cline from the placid sea to the tow-
ering heights beyond. it looked like
a marble stairway leading up to
heaven. so broad and grand in its
mighty sweep that all the tribes of
earth might mount upon it. It was a
picture that Milton or Homer might
have used in their immortal epics of
gods and angels.

The water lapping over terraces
and leaping downward here and
there. was as white as milk and in the
distance looked like ganzy draperies
of lace and down spread on the
mighty stairway.“ archangel: might
spread them for gods to walk upon.
No grander sight was ever looked
upon by seer or prophet in the most
enraptured vision.

This phenomenon. so remarkable
in these regions of ice and snow.
where the temperature is always below the freezing point. was caused
by the heat of Mount Erebus melt-
ing the ice and snow that climbed up
its sides for thousands of feet. The
volcano was in' a mild state of erup-
tion and I suppose the hidden ﬁres
on this side had melted down the ice
walls and worn away this great thor-
oughfare to the sea 1) ' pouring down
a continuous Hood 0 water. The as-
cent looked accessible and I deter-
mined to make an eﬂ'ort to reach the
great cone and have a view of these
unknown regions. We had Christ-
mas dinner on board. after which
Captain Brent read from his manual
a service suitable for the occasion.
and perhaps with the exception oi
myself. every one on the ship yearn-
ed for home and its associations. on
this day of universal joy and glad-
ness. The boys looked blue enough until I brought out a great bowl of
punch. but that soon brought them
back to a state of warmth and merri~
ment. A ﬁne carouse the fellows had.
and when I proposed to lead a party
to climb Mount Erebus next day.
every one volunteered to go and my
only difﬁculty was in making a se-
lection. I chose three of the hardiest
and the next morning with rubber
boots reaching to our waists and so
wrapped in woolens that we might
pass a night without harm. (if
we could but get above the ice and
water.) we lowered a boat and pulled
in to the shelving beach. taking
along an extra crew to carry the boat
back to the vessel. Laying our boat
alongside the ice we had no diﬂiculty
in effecting a landing. as the water
was quite smooth and in many places
we could easily step out on to the ice.

To my surprise I found the ascent less difﬁcult than I expected. Picking out the easiest ways and keeping as much as possible out of the water. we reached a secondary cone or summit about two-thirds of the way up as darkness, or rather the twilight of
the Antarctic night, closed in upon us. The surface was quite dry and warm, and I never spent a more comfortable night in these frozen regions than on this lofty peak of Mount Erebus. Getting under a ledge of rocks that sheltered us from the wind, which cut like a knife. we slept soundly without fear of mice or bedbugs. That night we witnessed the grandest display of the aurora australis that perhaps any human eyes ever looked upon before. We were eight or nine thousand feet above the sea, and the luminous hands of purple and orange coloured light seemed to spring up from all around us and as they spread towards the zenith and then dipped umbrella shaped to the horizon, the white desolation of this frozen world was suffused with supernatural glory. As we looked out and away on the endless panorama of crags and cliffs and peaks of what seemed to be mountain ranges below us, all deathly white in this unearthly light, it looked like the ghost of a dead world. The scene was overpowering and after a hasty survey, we were glad to clamber down into our little gorge, out of the uncanny light and smoke our pipes, and hear each other's voices, to bring us back, as it were, to ourselves. This volcano is on the coast of Victoria land and in all probability we were the ﬁrst human beings who ever set foot on it. It is between 70 and 80 degrees south latitude and looking east or west as far as the eye could see, with the exception of the stairway like slope up which we had climbed, stretched an unbroken wall of ice. Looking southward though with the aid of a glass, I could plainly see an open sea very much like that on the north and clearer of ice. I studied the situation carefully. Here was the impentrable ice barrier that had bafﬂed every explorer of these southern seas. All below this latitude was supposed to be a continent of ice and snow. Men had sailed down here and been dashed against this wall or had gone back dismayed. But here on the south was the open sea which, if it could be reached, offered to the curious navigator opportunity to go, heaven only knew where. The more I looked at that great open sea, the more I became convinced that there was a passage somewhere through the icy wall cOnnecting these two bodies of water.

We made the descent without incident, and I instructed Captain Brent to hold a safe distance from the ice and circumnavigate the entire Antarctic circle or ﬁnd a passage through the ice. Fully imbued then with the idea that the earth was a sphere, I supposed that this body of water on the south was simply an open polar sea, surrounded by walls of ice.

The next day it came on to blow a gale of sleet and snow and we
sought northward for four days through such a storm as can only rage in the frozen seas about the south pole. During these entire four days it was so dark that we could not see the topmast from the deck though every spar and shroud was white with ice. Several times
